Great! Let’s get started on reverse-engineering your app idea. I’ll guide you step by step through the process, asking targeted questions to gather all the necessary information. Once we have enough details for a section, I’ll generate the corresponding document and ask for your feedback before moving on to the next section.

Let’s begin with the App Idea & Scope. This will help us understand the core purpose of your app, its target audience, and the key features you envision.

App Idea & Scope
App Idea:
Can you describe your app idea in detail? What problem does it solve, and who is it for?

For example: Is it a fitness app that helps users track workouts, a social platform for connecting people, or a productivity tool for managing tasks?

What makes your app unique compared to existing solutions?

Target Audience:
Who are the primary users of your app? Describe their demographics, goals, and pain points.

For example: Are they young professionals, students, fitness enthusiasts, or small business owners?

What challenges do they face that your app will address?

Key Features:
What are the main features of your app? List them in order of priority.

For example: User authentication, a dashboard, real-time notifications, or a payment system.

Which features are essential for the MVP (Minimum Viable Product)?

Platform:
Will this app be for mobile (iOS/Android), web, or both?

Do you have a preference for a specific platform, or should it be cross-platform?

Timeline:
What is your desired timeline for the project?

For example: Do you want an MVP in 3 months, or are you aiming for a full launch in 6 months?

Let’s start with the first question:
Can you describe your app idea in detail? What problem does it solve, and who is it for?

Take your time to explain, and I’ll help refine your idea as we go!

Say goodbye to your old TV

00:00:02 --> 00:00:06
as Walmart's currently doing a huge hidden clearance event.

00:00:06 --> 00:00:09
Now what do I mean by hidden clearance?

00:00:09 --> 00:00:10
Well check this out

00:00:10 --> 00:00:13
because half of you are gonna go online and tell me

00:00:13 --> 00:00:14
not at my location.

00:00:14 --> 00:00:18
These three UPCs are currently on hidden clearance in store.

00:00:18 --> 00:00:21
Now my location had them in the back,

00:00:21 --> 00:00:24
so I asked an employee to bring one out for me

00:00:24 --> 00:00:26
so you guys can see the price.

00:00:26 --> 00:00:29
Now you'll have to go to your local store to find stock,

00:00:29 --> 00:00:30
or you can join our group

00:00:30 --> 00:00:34
as we can now search a 200 mile radius for the exact stock,

00:00:34 --> 00:00:36
the exact location, but most importantly,

00:00:36 --> 00:00:38
the exact clearance price.

00:00:38 --> 00:00:42
Now let's head over to self checkout so you guys can see the price!

00:00:43 --> 00:00:46
Now remember, these TVs are in hidden clearance

00:00:46 --> 00:00:50
as this 55 inch model retails for 3 99

00:00:50 --> 00:00:56
and we've been picking these up as low as you guessed it. $99!

Stop scrolling because you're about to run to Walmart.

00:00:04 --> 00:00:05
Do you see these vacuums?

00:00:05 --> 00:00:10
They're originally $279 all the way down to 70 bucks.

00:00:10 --> 00:00:11
But that's not all.

00:00:11 --> 00:00:16
You guys keep watching because we haven't even started yet.

00:00:16 --> 00:00:18
Now make sure you guys are looking high and low

00:00:18 --> 00:00:21
because they're all over the place.

00:00:21 --> 00:00:25
We found two more at top stock, so you know, we had to get them down.

00:00:26 --> 00:00:30
And this 300 dollar model all the way down to 47 dollars.

00:00:31 --> 00:00:33
Guys, we're not done.

00:00:33 --> 00:00:35
We're jam packing the deals today.

00:00:36 --> 00:00:37
Yep, that's right,

00:00:37 --> 00:00:39
only 70 bucks.

00:00:39 --> 00:00:41
But wait, there's more.

00:00:42 --> 00:00:45
Now, if you guys want to score like this in your local area,

00:00:45 --> 00:00:46
we have a group

00:00:46 --> 00:00:51
where we can help you find exactly which store has them on clearance,

00:00:51 --> 00:00:57
how many are in stock, and the exact clearance price.

You ain't ready for this one.

00:00:02 --> 00:00:04
Milwaukee just did us a favor

00:00:04 --> 00:00:10
and dropped a 527 dollar nail gun to an insane run deal.

00:00:11 --> 00:00:13
Now once I found the item,

00:00:13 --> 00:00:15
I noticed they were on hidden clearance.

00:00:16 --> 00:00:18
So I quickly grabbed an employee

00:00:18 --> 00:00:21
and I had them pull them all out for me.

00:00:21 --> 00:00:23
I couldn't believe the guy's face

00:00:23 --> 00:00:25
after he saw the prize.

00:00:25 --> 00:00:26
That's right you guys.

00:00:26 --> 00:00:29
A 500 dollar Milwaukee

00:00:29 --> 00:00:31
down to 88 dollars.

00:00:32 --> 00:00:33
Now, this was all possible

00:00:33 --> 00:00:35
thanks to our moderator in our group.

00:00:36 --> 00:00:40
She quickly alerted us to make sure we scored.

00:00:40 --> 00:00:44
And here it is for the non believers at self checkout.

00:00:44 --> 00:00:47

00:00:48 --> 00:00:50
as our group took stock.

00:00:51 --> 00:00:52
Now before you ask,

this is available in all 50 states.

Does Milwaukee ever penny out?

00:00:03 --> 00:00:04
Keep watching

00:00:04 --> 00:00:05
and you'll find out.

00:00:06 --> 00:00:08
Our moderator inside of our group

00:00:08 --> 00:00:11
told me to come exactly to this location,

00:00:11 --> 00:00:14
as we have a penny item for you guys today.

00:00:14 --> 00:00:18
And this specific item retails for $99

00:00:18 --> 00:00:20
all the way down to one penny.

00:00:21 --> 00:00:22
I couldn't believe that

00:00:22 --> 00:00:24
it was literally sitting right there.

00:00:25 --> 00:00:27
If you guys have been watching my lives,

00:00:27 --> 00:00:29
you know that these have been reselling

00:00:29 --> 00:00:32
for a minimum of $75.

00:00:33 --> 00:00:35
Now, if you guys are ready to make this happen

00:00:35 --> 00:00:36
in your local area,

00:00:36 --> 00:00:38
make sure you hit that follow button

00:00:38 --> 00:00:41
and let me know in the comments which state you're from

00:00:41 --> 00:00:43
so we can get started.

00:00:43 --> 00:00:45
And just like that,

00:00:45 --> 00:00:47
one penny. Now,

00:00:47 --> 00:00:49
this is just a drop in the bucket.

00:00:02 --> 00:00:05
and it's our most profitable find this year.

00:00:06 --> 00:00:07
And the funny thing is

00:00:07 --> 00:00:10
some groups are just finding out about this deal,

00:00:10 --> 00:00:13
but our members have been cleaning up all month.

00:00:13 --> 00:00:16
Now I will give you a nice little tip at the very end,

00:00:18 --> 00:00:20
Now shout out to our moderator in our group

00:00:20 --> 00:00:24
as she sent me specifically to this location

00:00:24 --> 00:00:28
where all vacuums dropped 75% off.

00:00:28 --> 00:00:31
Now make sure you take a screenshot of this cue

00:00:31 --> 00:00:32
as these are the two

00:00:32 --> 00:00:35
specifically you will be looking for.

00:00:35 --> 00:00:38
Now make sure you show some respect to these employees

00:00:38 --> 00:00:41
as not every location is dropping.

00:00:41 --> 00:00:42
But of course

00:00:42 --> 00:00:43
that is where we come in.

00:00:44 --> 00:00:46
So if you wanna get started in your local area,

00:00:46 --> 00:00:48
you know what to do.

00:00:48 --> 00:00:51
Let me know in the comments and let's get started.

00:00:51 --> 00:00:52
Now here's your tip.

00:00:52 --> 00:00:54
Inventory is off

00:00:54 --> 00:00:56
so make sure to check top stock.

Got it! Thanks for clarifying the flow. Since you’re an affiliate for FlipFluence, the Sign-Up Process will redirect users directly to the Whop platform (https://whop.com/flipfluence/?a=digitalartlab) after they click the CTA button. This means we won’t need a form on your website, and the process will be streamlined. Let me update the User Flow Documentation accordingly.
