        <article class="prose dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
          <p>Finding hidden clearance deals at Walmart can feel like a treasure hunt. These aren't your typical advertised sales; they're often items marked down significantly in-store without much fanfare. Here's how you can start uncovering these bargains:</p>

          <h2>1. Understand the Lingo</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Hidden Clearance:</strong> Items discounted in the store's system but not always marked clearly on the shelf.</li>
            <li><strong>Penny Items:</strong> Products that have reached their final markdown and ring up for just $0.01. These are rare!</li>
            <li><strong>YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary):</strong> Deals can be highly location-specific. What's on clearance in one store might be full price in another.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2. Use Scanning Tools (Like the Walmart App)</h2>
          <p>The official Walmart app is your best friend. Use its barcode scanner feature while in-store:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Scan items that look out of place, are dusty, or seem like seasonal leftovers.</li>
            <li>Check end caps and dedicated clearance aisles, but don't stop there â€“ hidden deals can be anywhere.</li>
            <li>The app price often reflects the store's system price, even if the shelf tag is wrong.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. Learn Clearance Tag Colors & Patterns (Varies by Store)</h2>
          <p>While not always consistent, some stores use specific tag colors or formats for different levels of clearance. Pay attention to tags that look different from the standard ones.</p>

          <h2>4. Join Communities (Like FlipFluence!)</h2>
          <p>Deal-finding communities like FlipFluence are invaluable. Members share real-time finds, stock levels, and tips specific to different locations. This saves you time and helps you target the best opportunities.</p>

          <h2>5. Be Persistent and Patient</h2>
          <p>Finding the best hidden deals takes time and effort. Visit stores regularly, scan consistently, and don't get discouraged if you don't find amazing deals every trip.</p>

          <p>By using these strategies, you'll be well on your way to finding those incredible hidden Walmart clearance deals!</p>
