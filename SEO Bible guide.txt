00:00:00        all right today I'm going to give you a very very quick rundown on how to rank on Google for just about anything um I'm going to go over probably just the simple part for example the on-site SEO i'm just going to walk you through exactly how to do it and um yeah I'll talk about everything else if you guys want me to make this a series let me know down in the comment section by commenting how to rank on Google for the YouTube algo um if I get let's say if I get 10 people to comment that I'll make


00:00:32        this a series i'll go over each step and we can go from there anyways for the next couple minutes let me eat some creatine plus report my numbers from the day before if you guys are into that simply skip on ahead um my tweet yesterday popped off that was nice here we go oh yeah real quick Styles um Sean decided to give away four age domains which is insane um I think they're up to DR20 which is crazy because for example my Eating Vancouver domain isn't even DR20 uh I think it's DR14 took two weeks


00:01:13        so it's not easy um and it's for free so why not here we go all right anyways yesterday we did 1912 in total revenue down $500 from the day before we have Amazon coming in at 1112 so 100 like $1,100 mediaine at $76 and the adult revenue source that we don't talk about at 724 let's go on with the episode all right so if you sign up for the first link in the YouTube description you got sent the URL to this sheet today is April 2nd episode 492 we're almost at 500 really insane really really insane


00:02:07        um 492 all right so how to rank on Google for anything i'm going to go over how to do it um like the things you need to have number one is on-site SEO for example if you don't even have your on-site it doesn't matter if I give you like Google's own domain you won't rank for anything well no yeah I agree with that if you don't like if you mess up the on-site nothing else matters all right so that's most important first and foremost on SEO so we're going to talk about that today we're going I'm going to teach you how


00:02:41        to do on-site SEO for a page super easy really it's super easy but then I think I want to dumb it down unbelievably hard for you guys because I don't know a lot of you guys are beginners right so I'm going to do on-site SEO and what else do you need you need link building which essentially is domain authority as well um so meaning your domain has to be aged really strong um but you can achieve that by yourself via link building all right and the last but not least is external signals meaning branded search volume so like why does


00:03:16        eating Vancouver do so well despite having very little links getting outlin by Yelp uh Open Table so on so forth why are we higher than them in certain queries right it's because we have a lot of external signals people googling our brand name etc etc right does that make sense um there are other things smaller things like that I won't even mention because I think that'll just confuse you guys So number one on-site SEO so the foundation of everything link building domain authority yes is important but without on-site SEO you


00:03:55        won't be able to rank so I would say most people can do on-site SEO it's very easy this part is the hard part most people get wrong external signals you could probably do this it's it's very easy to do that so like you can achieve external signals by running a lot of paid ads that's why ecom sites do so well on Google because for example if I I spend $1,000 a day on Facebook ads meta ads people will search Indexy on Google and like who the hell is Indexy you know what I mean or I can run a campaign you know you know those


00:04:26        advertising campaigns where they pay like PR companies like 200k retainer and then they they like just post billboards everywhere it's like who is indexy and people just Google who is indexy external signals and it's not just click-through rate you know um it's hard to explain but it's yeah external signals could be clickthrough rate it could be Chrome data so on so forth anyways let's talk about on-site SEO today we're going to talk about that um once again if you guys want me to make this a series let


00:04:58        me know so what am I going to be optimizing today obviously you guys already know on local rank.so which is our local rank tracker tool um I vibe coded a ton of free tools and I need to go through and optimize them right this one's already optimized but I want to show you how to create the content on this page so I already created the tool how do I advertise it right it'll be creating on-site SEO content foundational content right so let's see what we have here first the title is fine url to domain


00:05:36        extractor tool right fine fine maybe it could be a bit longer 50 to 60 characters as suggested by indexes SEO extension get it it's free search Indexy extension is probably the best out there look at all this beautiful beautiful beautiful i'm surprised you guys aren't doing it um so what do I need next i need a metad description is it important eh all right so um my target keyword is domain extractor i already found it via hrefs so what I do is I just search um URL to domain extractor find the highest search


00:06:19        volume keyword on hrefs and then I optimize for that so I've decided I'm going to optimize for domain extractor and then now here's what I'm going to do any any uh you can use chat GBT all right so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go in strategy be like uh help me write a 500word SEO article um that will sit on the page of a SEO tool that is an URL to domain extractor tool um please use the following keywords with the suggested frequency make sure you use each keyword at least once all right so what do I do


00:07:17        now i paste in the keywords right so you can go here so what this does actually what neuron writer does is it finds recurring keywords from other uh pages that rank for domain extractor right and then you'll see the top 10 on Google it says right here 130 words you know your boy wants to do 500 what are you going to do about it you know what I mean so I just do this suggested with terms with suggested use boom extended why not why not why not um all right boom okay uh [Music] headings and then I'll at the end I'll


00:08:17        be like here are some suggested H2 and H3 headings uh all right so uhupub export um give me the content as HTML but remove uh but do not include body or uh head simply give it to me in hes and I know paragraph format so I can paste into WordPress as an HTML i guess that makes sense all right yeah let's try it and um yeah I I'll give it back to you guys when I'm when it's done all right so now that this is done um what I did was I pasted it in here as an HTML file or HTML i don't even know what this is called right


00:09:21        looks simple enough right bada bing bada boom and then I pasted this into uh Neworn Rider just to see what kind of score we're getting we're getting 68 which is unbelievably strong by the way just really really good um not going to complain about this this is insane so we'll we'll we'll roll with this um I think I'm happy with this we can post this however before we do that I'm going to uh use a humanizer because I think we're on the site we're already kind of using too many um AI content so I want to humanize it


00:09:59        uh turnum.com if you guys want to get on it it's hella cheap it's a why not all right so after you humanize it I bring it back over to chat and I ask them to change it up or fix it into a HTML format paste it in looks good looks very good right that's it was that hard no i think this is pretty much the basics nowadays uh can I bulk optimize yes yes you can it's stupid easy um what am I going to do i'm going to add this to a parent so it'll appear um it will appear automatically here because I created


00:10:48        the where is it URL to extractor tool amazing here you go all right and you're probably wondering Jackie why did you create so many tools you know what i was building up uh I was figuring out ways to index our citations for citations by the way is the local s and I was like having to deal with a lot of the domains and I didn't actually have a centralized area for the domain so I was like you know what let me just create a tool real quick oneshotted it obviously um and it was fantastic so and I Googled you know


00:11:25        I just checked HFS i was like is there even demand for this and lo and behold there is so why not um local rank is already kind of popping in terms of Google um yeah I feel good about it it looks great man i'm really happy with where it's at did 14K in the first month can't complain all right there you go that's the episode let me know if you guys want to see more i can go on to the link building next uh but only if I get at least 10 of the comments all right take it easy guys before I get crucified for the


00:11:59        um thumbnail you can rank in 24 hours um you just have to if your site if you haven't checked off link building or domain authority external signals what you have to do is you're going to have to start off very low like you have to target keywords people aren't even targeting essentially but with the on-site once you get indexed most of the time you can get it ranked pretty easily all right um yeah anyways let's uh answer some questions from the day before here we go let's see channel members what what you guys got for


00:12:34        me what is this lag pretty insane million dollar SEO thank you James i might lose my VOIPE number I used if I change it on my site how much of an impact will this have um a lot SEO paid awesome i hate manually building links i do the citation with your indexer but I need more authority on my site to outrank massive DR brokerage companies okay um what would I do niche shadow so are you trying to do it with on a budget um niche shadows are typically the cheapest best value you create local rank with


00:13:11        cursor um Peter did what did you do with the create uh create user account system i don't even know i I always get stuck on that too anything with back end I get stuck on peter is obviously a developer so he already knows this stuff this made me wonder do citations only need to be supercharged with PBNs no no you don't you don't the SOP recommends tiering Kevin's PBN on Citation i'm wondering it's good not necessary but why not because it's so cheap right why not anyways um that's it for now guys uh


00:13:52        take it easy have a great rest of your day it's Wednesday hump day for me at least take it


-------------------------------------
00:00:01        so today I'm going to be showing you guys how I do a Content Gap now for anybody that doesn't know what a Content Gap is basically the simple premise is the more articles you have covering different topics to do with your product or your service on your website Google will deem you as more of a trustworthy source and they will essentially rank you higher on their algorithm so that's the very very layman's term so for example if you guys have just recently thrown up a two-page website on Google um Google doesn't first of all


00:00:39        understand what services you provide they don't understand who you are and you aren't actually covering any questions that people or your customer base might actually have prior to purchasing your product or your service which is again really important so um I'm going to show you guys a few different ways that you can do this um you can obviously uh use chat jbt for certain um things I'm going to show you there are free ways to do this there's also paid ways to do this um I'll cover both of those now one simple place to


00:01:12        start off prior to even doing any keyword research prior to looking at any tools is let's say for example you are a um let's say you're a dentist right there's going to be certain questions that people might have prior to even like like booking in a consultation so where I would start off is if you have got like a sales team that have been getting inquiries actually sit down with your sales team and ask them like what kind of questions are you guys getting over the phone or on emails prior to people


00:01:49        purchasing solar panels or let's say your a dentist prior to them booking in for a checkup and those questions nine times out of 10 you can actually turn those into blog articles cuz if your sales team is actually getting those questions um on phone calls or via um email and stuff there's going to be people searching that as well so again there's another place that you can actually show up on in terms of Google or Bing or whichever search engine you're trying to rank in and that is again just Another Touch point so just


00:02:22        bear that in mind now if we were to take a look at let's say um we will look at lawyers and London right or actually we'll go with like divorce divorce lawyers London so if we take a look at osbor law.com right if we were to take a look at their entire site so if we just do site colon and if we search just their website space divorce you can see um all of the actual blog articles now obviously they do do have a landing page where it is targeting like the bottom of the funnel somebody that's searching


00:03:06        divorce lawyers in London that's bottom of the funnel somebody that's searching that they just want to hire an actual lawyer but in a lot of cases people aren't at that step just yet so they might be searching for like certain keywords like who gets the house in a divorce um how long does a divorce cost um what happens to savings and investments in a divorce right so all of these are basically what's supporting articles blog articles that you should actually have posted on your the blog section of your website um and again


00:03:39        when somebody's searching for that in London or in Manchester or New York or wherever your law form is based for example there's actually um more chance of your website actually getting clicks and although some people might not necessarily enjoy uploading these articles like I speak to a lot of business owners and they say like what's what's the point of um get like uploading an article for who gets the house in a divorce right now somebody that's searching this you need to think of where they are in the process they


00:04:09        might not be ready to inquire with a law firm today but they might be in a week's time or in two months time so as long as we can cover all aspects of the funnel that's basically where um Google will actually end up rewarding our website and ranking it higher now you will actually see this for any website um like for example if we were to do a search for let's say um HVAC company in Orlando right um so we've got these guys for example and again if we go to their website if we do the exact same thing and if we do hbac what


00:04:55        we're going to find is loads of blog articles uh and these are all basically supporting articles that will internally link through to our main service page so HVAC company and Orlando these are all going to be internally linking through to that page in one way shape or form um so just bear that in mind like for example this blog article um it's titled why is it important to consult with a professional for an hfac installation um then we've got should I set my HVAC system to Auto or on um again these are all like


00:05:33        different questions like for example if you're a hak company is slightly different to law but you could actually go down like um a load of error codes so for example the Phillips hitac let's say error code 5502 and all of these blog articles will actually gain clicks through to your website so always just think of like these different angles that you can actually publish um blog articles so now that you understand the process of actually gaining blog articles right um a few things to bear in mind is if


00:06:09        you actually search um for your competitor let's say and if you click on tools what you'll actually be presented by here is the amount of Articles or pages that this website actually has indexed by Google so again if you're coming along with like a five-page website that you've just launched two weeks ago right and all of your competitors have let's say 169 250 480 Pages live um that's actually being indexed and crawled by Google basically means that you've got a lack of Articles like again if we were to do it for this


00:06:46        website here right if we do site colon and if we do tools this P this page or this website has 235 results so there's a lot of articles that we would be missing out on especially if we are have just created a brand new website um within the past like month or so so then what I would be looking at doing is actually identifying the pages that we need live on our website so for example um this website here it covers a lot of different Services it covers air conditioning it covers heating it covers


00:07:22        duct work it covers commercial HVAC indoor air quality um same goes with these guys right if we were to actually take a look at this website so these guys covered personal injury family property private claims housing and social care medical negligence notary international law um again the the list goes on and on I could I could load up a a dental website and dental clinic and we'll [Music] do um we will do um Texas right random dental clinic in Texas so again if we take a look at these guys they've got different


00:08:10        Services very similar to all of these right so like dental implants Dental extractions teeth cleaning dental X-rays Dental fillings so on and so forth right now as a rule of fun if you are just launched your website for every single service I would recommend as an app absolute bare bare bare bare minimum five blog SLS supporting articles per service page so for example if I'm um trying to rank higher for dental implants right I might have an article on um let's let's take a look let's let's actually do some digging dental


00:08:54        implants um cost right so we could actually have a cost of dental implants page now when you're actually analyzing all of the blog or supporting articles that you should be publishing through to your website one thing to make certain of is that there isn't any overlap so for example if I had just searched that and this page was ranking for that keyword that would mean that I would actually look or when I'm building out that article I would actually have this as a question on this page I wouldn't


00:09:31        actually build out two separate blog articles but as you can see there is actually different intents um for that so I would definitely create a dental implants page but like let's let's have some um let's do a little bit more searching right so does dental implants hurt right again this deserves its own page because if you take a look at this this is a completely different article to what's actually um ranking so they've got like a blog article here so does dental implant surgery hurt but then they will also have a dental implant um


00:10:06        service page as well and if it again if somebody's searching for dental implants in simple simp Simpsonville SC um they are basically ready to to actually inquire with that dental practice but to actually get this page to rank it's very very important that we actually have enough um supportting articles so that's when I say as an absolute minimum let's say you've got five different Services that's five landing pages so let's say we've got um personal injury lawyers family lawyers property lawyers Private


00:10:42        Client lawyers and housing and social care lawyers right so that's our five landing pages but for each of those landing pages I would also include five blog articles so we're actually looking at five we're looking at 30 blogs or sorry 25 blogs and five landing pages um in total so just bear that in mind I know it's a little bit of a complicated mix but that's that's what I would be looking at now you can use very very simple prompts um but I would always check them in terms of Google right so let's say for


00:11:21        example um we use something like I want to rank for what are some questions slash blogs that people might have prior to inquiring with me so this is going to have or it's it should throw out some fairly decent FAQs right so what is the process of getting a divorce in the UK or how long does it take to get a divorce in the UK let's actually search that up um and as you can see here we've got how long does a divorce take in the UK how long does it take to get a divorce in the UK um so I would definitely actually have that as a


00:12:14        separate blog article but then there there's actually like some costs involved so how much does a divorce lawyer in London cost so again just make certain all of these you're actually searching up um on Google and you're making certain that it deserves its own page um like what I mentioned before if there was one page ranking for five or six different queries that I plugged in I would actually have all of those queries or questions on the one page so again you're not just making tons of overlap in Googles that just getting


00:12:45        confused at that point so how much is a child custody or how is child custody decided in a London divorce cases now one thing to bear in mind obviously I've mentioned in the prompt I want to rank for divorce lawyers in London with chat gbt I have noticed that it will try and force the keyword in all of your blog articles now if we take a look at this one for example how how is child custody decided in London divorce cases now this might be a little bit different in the US because obviously in the US


00:13:21        there's different laws in for example Orlando to California or from Florida to California should I say um in the UK it's all pretty much the same so I would actually probably substitute the London in this case to just being in the UK um because again it doesn't matter if you are in Manchester or if you are in Liverpool the law is going to stay the same um to my knowledge anyway but obviously that might be a little bit different in terms of if you're in America or if you're in Canada for example there might be different state


00:13:57        laws um so just bear that in mind now if again if we were to do um the exact same thing when it comes to dental clinic in Texas can you do the same now for dental clinic in Texas so again these are going to or what typically happens is it will group together different services so again like what I was mentioning before if you're just going to if you just care about Dentistry maybe you want to rank higher for um Dental checkups in Texas for example you might decide to to actually have free blog articles here um


00:14:42        but let's see how much do teeth whitening cost in Texas let's actually Google that cost of teeth whitening near me in Texas how much does laser teeth whitening cost in Houston perfect now again you might decide to substitute to Texas for the town that you're trying to rank for let's say you're trying to rank in Houston or let's say you're trying to rank in Miami you might decide to actually substitute that and not just go after the entire State as well so just bear that in mind um now obviously these


00:15:13        are local or these are like um businesses that you would go to um but let's say for example if if we're an eCommerce store right um can you do the same for a Ecom store um I sell um electric scooters right um the exact same thing buy electric scooter let's see um let's just close down some of these tabs what I'm trying to get across in this video is that it doesn't matter if you are a local business if you're an Ecom store the premise is still the same um it obviously just depends on the type of


00:16:06        um the actual type of product or the type of service that you're providing obviously the there's going to be certain questions like for example how to extend the battery life of your scooter let's say right um let's just take a look here so let's take a look and see what blog articles they actually have blog so why folding uh matters in a scooter what are electric scooters made for or who are electric scooters made for let's see if they have um battery maintenance guide for your electric scooter


00:16:53        um we uncover the ugly truth about your tires a complete guide to buying an electric scooter as you can see although they do have the actual products and the actual product pages like for example if we head over to um this here which seems to be like a mclarin inspired um electric scooter so this is like what's deemed as like a product page but they also do have like comparison Pages as well so you can compare two different products on your e-commerce store or you can do like buying guides or you can do like repair


00:17:31        guides as well so there's all of these different uh ways that you can rank an e-commerce store but again the same premises applied it doesn't matter if you're like a local business an Ecom store an affiliate website or everything that you're seeing will apply to your SEO strategy in some way shape or form the one thing that I would spend quite a lot of time on is actually Googling all of these and making certain that they're that you should actually be building a page like for example if I don't see any


00:18:00        of my competitors going after that keyword if if um if it just looks like a very very like super bespoke keyword I might not decide to build out an actual article for that but include it on another page as well so just bear that in mind when you are doing topical Authority but that's been my video um there's obviously different ways that you can do this this was like more of a freeway just by using chat gbt looking at your competitors um but if you guys do have any questions feel free to drop them down in the


00:18:33        actual comment section down below and as always if you guys do want a growth strategy call make certain to check out cash.com the link for that will be in the actual description and if you guys are in the UK or if you guys are in Europe make certain to buy your tickets to the masterminder we have got an actual in-person event on the 27th of June in 2025 in Manchester I hope to see you all there thanks


-------------------------------


00:00:01        today I'm going to be showing you guys how to acquire your first 100 back links now this video will apply more so to new websites um and also a little bit to older websites as well I'm going to go over the entire process of grouping your back links so for example knowing which type of links you need to get to be a foundational link um doing the actual Outreach process and also identifying which type of links you website needs cuz one thing to bear in mind is that not every single back link that you can


00:00:35        acquire for your website actually has a positive effect some back links actually have a negative effect and they can actually um impact your website's rankings as well so that's what we're going to cover in this video um very very quickly if you guys want to attend a in-person conference um I am hosting one on the 27th and the 28th of June 2025 um it is in Manchester so if you want to fly in um you can do or if you are just a UK based you can actually travel there um but we've got some brilliant speakers uh we've got the


00:01:10        likes of Craig Campbell James douly um Carrie Rose from rise at 7 and Jason eny and stuff so if you guys want to know a little bit more check out the link and grab your tickets but let's actually get into this so the first process that we want to actually do is we want to make certain who our competitors are are right this is one of the most important things when it comes to backlink analysis this is where a lot of people actually fall short on um identifying your competitors it's literally when


00:01:42        you're looking at uh what which type of links to acquire for your websites it's data in data out so if you're looking at the wrong data sets you can go and build the most incorrect or the worst type of links um and even in some cases you can go and build some really expensive links and it might not push the needle for your website so this is really important um let's actually search for a keyword we'll go after something that's like pretty competitive um something along the lines of personal injury lawyers


00:02:19        and we'll do a random town in America um let's just go to Google Maps um I am actually not that clued up when it comes to towns in America uh we will go we'll go of Dallas right relatively large Town um so as you can see here right one thing to bear in mind when you are doing competitor analysis is that you've obviously got like the justas of the world and these are like um these are like directories now I'm not saying that you shouldn't um get yourself listed on these directories but in a lot of cases directories have a lot


00:03:03        of links going through to them some links you can't actually acquire for your website no matter how hard you try so in some cases when you we are looking at doing um competitor analysis for these actual links it's actually important to make certain that you're creating a list and you are ignoring the the actual like directories of the world right so for example just.com if we if we were to actually look at this website on a DS I believe it's like a dr80 website dr90 website it's got a lot of backlinks so


00:03:43        for you to compare your website to just it's just not fair it's always just going to say you're going to need six million back links right um so just bear that in mind when you are looking at competitor analysis but let's take a look at like 1,800 lion law right so this is an actual law form this is if if say for example I had casra personal injury lawyers right this is something that I would be actually um looking at and thinking okay what what backlinks do these guys have that I don't have um


00:04:15        this would be a website I would be looking at Mullen and Mullen dcom would be another website this is an actual Law Firm right um attorneys do Super Lawyers wouldn't be one because I believe believe this is also another yeah so if we were to actually take a look at this on ah refs right this is another directory and again when you're looking at directories it's literally just not fair um to compare yourself to these guys unless by the way unless you actually have got a directory that's the one caveat to all of this so as you can see


00:04:52        here again these guys have 40,000 back Lings if you're just starting out even if even if you were to get um one pound or if if it was one pound per back link which is not you would still need to spend £3,000 or $30,000 on on link so just ignore the actual um directories right what we want to then do is go to competitive analysis on AHS and this is actually going to give us um a section to plug in our own website so I've just put in like a dummy domain um kazra personal lawyers.com and then what we're going to do is we're


00:05:33        going to actually grab our competitors the competitors that aren't actually directories that's super important then we've got this one and we will include a third one as well here and we'll click on referring domains so make certain that you're looking at referring domains and not keywords unless you want to take a look at the articles that you're compe editors have that you don't have that's when you put in keywords but let's take a look at the link opportunities right so for example from the word go we've got


00:06:12        1,478 now does that mean that we need 1,478 links definitely not when it comes to link building the number one rule prior to even doing any link building by the way is making certain that your content is up to par making certain that your internal link is really good making certain that your technical SEO is really good right A lot of people think okay if I go and get these 1,478 back links I'm going to rank now you could have like really bad technical um or you could have really bad on page SEO even if you were to go and get 6,000


00:06:48        back links you're never going to rank so just bear that in mind like it's really really important prior to you even doing anything else in this video that you've got really good content that you have got really good technical SEO your internal linking is really good your onpage SEO is really good all your te your um topical Authority on your website's also um spot on because otherwise you're going to need you're going to need to end up spending more money on the amount of links that you actually need for your website like for


00:07:19        example even though that this is saying 1,478 links right if we were to go and build for with our um technical SEO knowledge and with our our actual SEO knowled knowledge that have been demonstrating on this on these YouTube videos right if we were to go and build out a website we might be able to get similar rankings with like 450 500 backlinks so now that you guys know that right we want to set up a few different filters because this isn't just enough right we want to make certain that first of all we're looking at um if we're


00:07:51        going after like um foundational links we want to go after like no follow right for no follow links first of all so they've got 407 um domains that are all no follow backlinks and typically speaking I'm not saying all the time but typically speaking the no follow links are more so like this directories the foundational links these are the type of links that you want to go and acquire first because as soon as you start to acquire some of these foundational links like the like um justia.com for example that's going to


00:08:26        be showing Google that you are actually part of the um lawyers in Dallas Corpus so for example if you are just completely brand new Google doesn't know who you are Google doesn't know who to compare you to but as soon as Google sees that okay KRA personal injury lawyers they are being shown on the same page as Jimmy danan and Nolan Ryan and Regis Mullen and all of these other law firms in Dallas that's when Google decides okay this is a person injury law fir we know what these guys do now we know what casra personal injury law does


00:09:05        you need to continuously keep feeding Google the correct lsis the correct competitors and that's when Google will say okay I know what these guys do um so if we take a look at some of these like Chamber of Commerce yeah this is again another directory another thing to bear in mind as well the no follow links a lot of the time they are are typically speaking free to acquire like for example Yellow Pages um I know that yell in the UK is free I'm not certain about Yellow Pages we can take a look now get started


00:09:43        today is it free an America it might not be um I could be wrong in saying that but in the UK for example if any of you guys are watching this in the UK you can get a free a completely free listing um on Yale in the UK so just bear that in mind when you are going through some of these now the process here is literally just going through all of these and getting um all of the directories some of which will be um aggregator links let's see if I can actually find some aggregator links like this for example


00:10:19        is an aggregator link um aggregator links you want to ignore they're not going to actually do anything they might even actually cause more harm like looking at some of the L the links in this list like for example cab. Ru I'm not going to click on that because I think that would probably get my channel banned um but as you can see that there is a lot of different like spammy links like pervert coach.com right you don't see that type of Link every single day um but just do the eyeball test as I like to call like for example attorney


00:10:53        help.org it's probably a relatively decent website to get a link on um obviously there's other metrics as well that you want to take a look at you want to be looking at at traffic um and so on and so forth so pho.com again this is another directory a little bit of a tip for this as well you can actually search um your Niche space directory and it will come back with a load of directories like for example if we were a dentist for example dentist directory as you can see here we have got a load of directories that we can


00:11:32        get listed on now if they're free or not that completely depends on the website some websites they do give you a free listing let's see what these guys do added listing um yeah so you've got a free listing they they've also got a paid listing as well um one thing to bear in mind as well as an absolute minimum you should probably get about 50 of these um we actually recommend probably a lot more um but if you want to Outsource this process head over to S true go to services and click on to link building


00:12:09        and local citations it is $1 per citations I know it says 30 but you end up getting 30 citation so if you want to Fast Track that if you don't want to be slaving away doing all of your directors yourself you can um go over to search rout or you can do it yourself um so that's number one that's all of the F foundational style links you can also do a few other things as well like you can put in certain Dr ranges like you can say I only want to look at directories from a Dr range of 40 and above and that's all obviously


00:12:43        going to lower the amount of actual links um so as you can see here we've got like good firms. co um so on and so forth so that is the first set of foundational links right now what we want to do is we want to flip this over and go to do follow and this is when we start doing some Outreach some do um some people call it guest posting some people call it Outreach um others also call it like Niche edits as well but we want to look at the do follow Links of these websites so this is basically links from other


00:13:21        websites that actually Pass power um through to our website now let's actually take a look at some of these because there's going to be a lot that we can actually get listed on um let's see so this is also one thing to bear in mind as well is sometimes you do get citations that are also do follow like for example this um this is a directory that also has a do follow link as well so just bear that in mind when you are going through some of these websites you will see some directories that are also


00:13:56        do follow links as well that's you should also get those types of links but let's take a look at some of these websites um the sapphire Mansion do this looks like a pbn um so this is what I mean like when we're looking at these when it's saying 1,14 links it's probably you probably only need to like worry about maybe half of that or maybe even quarter of the actual backlink profile so we're going to do a Dr range of 30 um and we're going to do from 30 to let's say 60 Dr so let's see what type of websites we


00:14:42        can actually get a link from so broke and check.com now I'm not saying that this is a relatively good website I'm not saying it's a bad website but it's a website that all three of our competitors actually have a link from um these guys actually have two links from them right and it's also pointing through to car accidents in Texas page as well right so what we would probably want to do is car accident lawyers Dallas car acent lawyers right let's just take a look here this is one of our competitors it's ranking


00:15:24        this is another one of our competitors it's ranking so I mean it it seems like it's doing a relatively good job um this website even though it's not completely about law um let's see Beyond Beauty Beyond scars embracing your unique Journey after a car accident okay so I can see what they've done it like this is more of about like um a Beauty blog but they've kind of made it relevant to personal injury so I can I can understand the relevance right let's say we wanted to actually do Outreach through to this website um we would copy


00:16:01        all of the relevant links um so what I would be doing here right is doing like the eyeball test making certain that it obviously makes sense for us to get a link from any of these websites if our competitors have a link it's a good indicator but also make certain that you're looking at the Dr you're looking at the traffic you're looking at the website and what it's ranking for if it's passing all of those tests that's when I would start doing this next phase right so let's say for example example we've got like four or


00:16:30        five links that want that we want to do Outreach through to the next step is actually emailing this website so what I like to do is use a tool called hunter.io so this is what hunter.io looks like I believe you also can get um free um 50 submissions so you can actually check 50 um different websites for their email addresses right so if we go to company name here we can actually paste in the website that we want to actually reach out to and here it is here and if we click on the website as you can see it's got


00:17:11        one email address and if we click on to find email addresses it's going to actually um unblur it so it's going to say hey broken check.com we can then actually reach out to these guys and get a link placed on that website in some cases you can also find the um email if you just go to the contact Section I'm certain that it will probably be on here it's actually not um due to the current workload we have removed our contact UM information until September 2023 in the meantime best way to reach out to us


00:17:48        will be through Instagram which they've not even got their Instagram oh no they do okay so you can actually um reach out to these some profiles via Instagram in some cases you probably don't want to do that you probably just want to email them because it's just an easier back and forth um because everyone's just got an email so that's what I would be doing in this case um then and the next step would literally just be to email them saying like hey um you have linked out to our competitors can we also get a


00:18:19        link um something along those lines keep it short it doesn't need to be super long email um I will actually show you guys an example of an email that I actually send out that gets really good open rates so this is the actual email that we are actually going to be sending out so this is the subject line collaboration opportunity with casra law hi recipient you can even just delete that so it's just like hey there hey I hope this email finds you well I came across broke and chick and was impressed by the unique content and


00:18:54        value it provides um at casual law we're passionate about empowering individuals of accessible legal advice particularly on topics and C relevant topics here right we'd love to explore collaboration but that benefits both our readers and expertise whether it's a guest post resource link or another idea I'm confident we that we can create something valuable together let me know if this sounds interesting I'd be happy to discuss further best regards your name your position contact information and also your website and you can just


00:19:28        Swap this out for um as many different websites that you're reaching out to as well um the only po spots that you would actually need to swap out would literally just be here um so you would just need to swap out for the uh website that you're reaching out to so if you're reaching out to one to3 hello.com you would just swap that the broken check out to one to3 hello.com um and you can then just start sending out the emails um that way and that I believe is literally it so you would obviously want to create


00:20:04        like a list of let's say 40 or 50 backlinks um that you want to reach out to um obviously try these filters out you can obviously play around with the filters you can go a little bit lower you can go a little bit higher but typically when you we're doing Outreach like this we want to make certain that first of all the link that we're actually acquiring is do follow second of all the Dr range is actually there you can even put in like more um filters like traffic so for example anything above 1,000 traffic for


00:20:34        example and we've even lowered the actual list that way as well so we're looking at links that are only pointing through to one or maybe even two of our competitors so we've got like for example legal services link.com and again we would literally just copy this domain name we would head over to hunter.io and we would just grab their email that now this website actually doesn't have an email let me see how it's not got an email because it looks like it's directory that's probably why um but if it doesn't have an email


00:21:12        try and find the contact form and again same same goes with what I was showing you before you can literally just use the exact same um the exact same email template that I've just shown you here you can just paste it in and and you should be ready to go let's see if we can very very quickly find one last website with using hunter.io the newsg good.com so we've got the newsg good.com all you literally do is you just find uh click find email and then you've got admin thews good.com and then you can


00:21:50        just send out an email through to them so that's been the entire process from start to finish on how to build your first 100 back links for your website now obviously in certain industries you might need more foundational links or you might need more actual guest post so just bear that in mind that's it I hope you guys have enjoyed this video and if you guys obviously do want to attend the conference head over to the master reminders.com thanks for watching


---------------------------------


00:00:01        so I wanted to make this video showcasing to you guys what topical Authority looks like when it comes to ranking higher in Google right so we're looking at a website called gusto.com um they've done a very very good job when it comes to building out topical Authority now for any of you that don't know what topical Authority is and how it actually helps your website in very layman's terms right to build out topical auor you're demonstrating to Google you are an authorative figure in that industry


00:00:33        whether it's accounting whether it is law firms whether you're selling solar panels or whether you're selling um sports gear right on an ecomer store or sofas on an e-com store so basically what that means is that you can't no longer rank in Google or for a competitive keyword with just a single page so for example these guys they try to rank for keywords such as like like payroll for Real Estate payroll for Professional Services payroll for healthcare right these are some of the key words that they are trying to rank


00:01:08        for now if you're trying to come along you can't just build out a single page website going after payroll for healthcare because you're not demonstrating to Google that you are an authorative figure in that space these guys they've just got loads of Articles to do with payroll and Google will always just trust these guys because they are and answering way more questions than you are they have way more links they're getting way more traffic every single month through to the website now does that mean that you can't enter this in


00:01:41        that this industry and take over absolutely not we just need to know which articles is needed on our website to actually outperform them so if we take a look here right as you can see they've absolutely smashed out the park in the past five 10 years actually past 10 years they were ranking for absolutely no keywords um in 2015 and if we take a look here they are ranking for 4.2 million traffic value now obviously some of you guys 4.2 million traffic value is not something that you guys are obviously trying to achieve but this is


00:02:18        a really good um website to actually break down and see what they're doing right and just take small bits of what they're actually doing and replicating it on your actual SEO strategy so if we take a look here right um they do have a lot of different subdomains so whenever you actually take a look at their Pages it's actually indexed by Google it's slightly inaccurate because it's saying that they've got 15,800 pages indexed but if we actually take a look they've got like engineering. Gusto um in the index they


00:02:49        also have got dev. Gusto as well so they've got like a an internal like um development section of their website so that that's all also indexed but one thing that I actually have found that's going to help us out a lot is the sitemap of their website so if we take a look here they've got like payroll they've got taxes health insurance so on and so forth right so for every single industry that they've actually try to rank higher for they've also got a Blog section so if we take a look here right


00:03:22        if we take a look at their healthc care section so this is the page that is ranking for health or payroll for healthcare Industries right then if we take a look at their actual um healthare industry section so health insurance so as you can see there's a lot of different pages that they're going after when it comes to actual Healthcare um so as you can see here right they've got the one service page the one bottom of the funnel so somebody that's searching for or Healthcare payroll for example they're ready to buy they're


00:04:03        ready to actually inquire and create an account with gusto but they've also covered a lot of what I would call M uh middle of the funnel and also top of the funnel so keywords that people they're not necessarily ready to sign up with gusto just yet but they might have a few different questions same goes with like their um payroll for single employee businesses right now obviously um um somebody that's setting or searching for this they might not have that much business experience so they've got a


00:04:38        silo here called starting a business and this is all going to be internally linking back up to this page um so for example they've got like they're talking about business grants in different states um they are talking about tax incentives for your business as well questions that basically new people that setting up a business would actually have so this is what I mean they've clearly mapped out a complete Silo of questions that people would actually have prior to even setting up a business now you might be thinking why should I


00:05:15        even um set up a page for like for example Missouri tax incentives for your business right the whole P purpose of this blog is to just get more referral traffic and then power up your actual pages that you that do make you money so for example a smart payroll for single businesses right I don't know how much they actually earn but let's say it's £50 a month for $50 a month um by having this page here the the Missouri tax incentives for businesses right this might not generate them that much money


00:05:48        it might generate them let's say one or two leads of s a month but by having this page they're actually able to internally link to pages that do generate them a lot more money and actually passes a lot more link equity and a lot more link power as well another thing as well is when you're building out certain pages like this like Missouri tax incentives for your business you can actually get a lot more back links um through to this page as opposed to just your payroll for uh payroll services for small employee


00:06:23        businesses as well now obviously they've not got many links but I what I will do is I'll try and find the coup pages that have do that have got a lot of links going through to um a page that you do care about as well so just give me one second so if we take a look here right this is a page that they've actually published about two years ago now um and it's titled this is the best budget template for new business owners right and as you can see here right boom right at the beginning of the actual article


00:06:53        they are internally linking to so you're so you're starting a business right they're generally linking through to pages and blog articles that actually make sense right so they've got another page talking about applying for business loans and I'm going to assume that they're monetizing this by doing they could have monetized this page a little bit better by actually having like um affiliate to business loans but as you can see here they've went and done a load of different actual internal links so like payroll


00:07:30        um this is going through to their actual service page so this is for people that want to sign up to their payroll services but if we actually take a look at this page right it's ranking for uh if we take a look here over just over 300 keywords it's actually ranking for and if we actually take a look at the amount of back links that this page actually has so it's got links from like uh HubSpot sales force um coefficient these are all like Dr 60 plus we we sites fil scale. blogger SEO how to set up a


00:08:05        business Tech Pro Tech Pro reviews so as you can see they've been able to get a lot of links so they've just got a 100 let's just do one group yeah so they've got 100 referring domains pointing through to this blog and just by being able to internally link to pages that they actually do care about and it actually does generate and they they generate the them cash it makes sense for now being able to give away this free uh budget template I'm actually curious to see what it actually looks like let's see yeah so it's it's also an


00:08:40        email capture as well um but as you can see this is how you're able to formulate like your blogs and being able to turn these blogs into link magnets um so just by being able to cover like top of the funnel and middle of the funnel you're able to actually generate a lot of back links and then link these blog posts to your bottom of the funnel Pages such as your smart payroll for single businesses um or your Healthcare um payroll page so a few things that you can actually do on how you can um replicate this strategy is you can


00:09:20        also use the article finder sheet that I've actually set up so if you guys do want I'll um this link will be in the description um you'll be able to actually copy this so just click on the article finder sheet click on file and then just make a copy for yourself I will do copy article finder for gust right so just make a copy um and then once this has finished what this will basically allow us to do is if we just click on allow access we're actually able to put in any of our compet etor s Maps followed up with a


00:10:03        actual um keyword and basically what this will tell us is the amount of blog articles that they actually have on our website that we don't have um on our website so for example as you can see here right this is just a example site where it's ranking high in the UK for um divorce lawyers right and as you can see here if I just zoom in I've all I've done is I've just put in my competitor site map and Then followed up with the keyword which is divorce now one thing I will mention as well is if the site map


00:10:38        or if the website's absolutely ginormous it might have a slight issue when it comes to actually loading that site map so let's just take a look here right if I was to do the exact same thing for a keyword like let's do dentists and um we'll do dentists and leads right what I'll do is I will just go to the top ranking website and we'll check out their site map hopefully these guys do actually have a site map cuz some websites just don't which is rather annoying there we go so we'll just copy this site map in


00:11:19        here right and we'll pick a actual service that we would want to rank higher for we'll do um teeth whitening right tooth whitening and we will let it do its thing so as you can see here this website actually has three articles that are supporting articles for their main T tooth whitening um page so they've got like fre blogs that is basically just talking about why why to tooth whitening is important does it work etc now we can actually do this for like any keyword or any service that they are trying to rank


00:12:08        for so again in the dental space another service that people try to rank very high for is implants and that's because it's very lucrative um and as you can see here right they don't just have the main service page for dental implants um so this is their main service page this is the page that when people search for this keyword they're ready to inquire with two 209 NYC Dental um but as you can see here they've got like a lot of different blog articles so they've got like Dental or dental implants versus


00:12:42        Dentures they've got advantages of dental implants um so as you can see Dent Dentures versus implants pros and cons and then they've got seven advantages of dental implants and it's just a Blog article talking about why people should look to get a dental implant another area that you can actually start when it comes to like building out topical Authority especially if like you're a Bonafide business and stuff like that is go and sit down with your actual sales team and ask them like what kind of questions do


00:13:15        you guys get or do you or do you get prior to actually closing the sale um and I'm I can guarantee this if your salesperson is getting those questions on calls or or via emails and stuff like that there's definitely going to be going to be people searching that in Google as well so that's always another good starting point like for example if you are selling solar panels let's say people might be asking your sales reps like what time is the best to actually charge up the actual solar panels like


00:13:54        in the UK it's actually cheaper to um charge up the battery during night um especially in summer and stuff like that because there's not many people using the actual um electricity and stuff so there's all of these different questions that your salespeople would get um without you even knowing and those would actually turn into like really good blog articles like going back to this Gusto website they actually rank for a lot of keywords based off of um the actual forms when you're sending it through to


00:14:26        the actual US Government so I'll I'll find a couple examples um and I'll share those with you so all I've done is I've just went to ah refs and I've just obviously putting gusto.com and I've just put in any show me all keywords that actually have the word form so as you can see here right they're ranking for like W4 form 2025 W9 Form 2024 CP 57 form um so if I actually search CP 575 for so this is what they're actually ranking for now if you think of the thought process right somebody that's searching for that form they may as well


00:15:05        be or they might be a business owner they might also need Payroll Services as well so as you can see they've got the big call to action here um and then they're obviously talking about the CP 575 form how to get it how to fill it out etc etc just been overall very useful and helpful and they've also got a video explaining what the CP 575 form is as well now this is another example as well um I'm I'm try I'm trying to show you as many different examples to get you guys in the in the thought process of how to build out topical


00:15:38        Authority right but this is a website in the UK that ranks for all of the boiler error codes now again if you think of it right somebody that's searching for a boiler error code in some cases they might need maintenance they might need to fully replace the boiler guess what they've already landed on this page here the back C one fault code oh guess what I need a new boiler who am I going to inquire with these guys right because I'm already on their on their page so this is another way to actually build


00:16:09        out topical Authority it's a really smart way of doing it as well um now again not every single error code means that you need to replace your boiler in some cases it might just mean you need a a monthly or a year or sorry a yearly maintenance as well so again I'm going to assume that these guys do that um and again these guys they just rank for a lot of different error codes So like um back C E1 error code Valiant boiler F22 error code and so on and so forth how to fix E1 free free error code on boiler as well so

--------------------------------------


00:00:00        so today I'm going to be showing you guys the off-page SEO strategy that you should be following along when it comes to building out a local website it's relatively easy to do not many people do it I've actually improved upon this sop within the past couple of weeks because there's a few different tools that I'll be using which is just makes off page s on link building just way too easy now so if you haven't already this is going to be or this video that you're watching right now is going to go be going into


00:00:31        my local SEO 2025 stepbystep playlist there's already four videos in that this is going to be the fifth one and then if you guys do have any questions and stuff like that feel free to drop them down below and I'll make like a six video for this but very quickly if you guys haven't already check out the mastermind.com I am hosting a in-person SE conference on the 27th of June in Manchester you're going to be able to learn from the likes of myself Craig Campbell Lara James dly carry Rose and many many more as well


00:01:04        there's going to be 150 people attending so make certain to grab your tickets well you can now going back to the actual off page SEO and stuff like that uh one thing that's really important especially once you've started to build out topical Authority once you've started building out your service Pages your local landing pages is The off-page SEO side of stuff which sometimes it makes me laugh when I speak to some business owners and they say oh my seo's been finished and it's like well just by


00:01:35        getting a 100 score on your Yost or your rank math it doesn't mean that your seo's complete right because obviously you need to get more links you need to get more casts of votes going through to your website and to build out that link Authority now if you take a look at like any website that's ranking for a relatively hard keyword whether it's like dentists in Manchester or whether it is lawyers in New York or solar panel company in or solar installation company right all of these websites once you


00:02:05        start doing a little bit of digging they're going to have two really good things they're going to have one being really good topical Authority so they're covering all of their services and all of their blogs and stuff like that which I've covered in previous videos so I'm not going to dabble into too much of that but the second thing that you'll notice is that a lot of websites will have what's called like citations or directories and the one annoying thing about directories previously was like


00:02:32        finding out which directories actually push the needle or which directories don't hold any value and stuff like that now directory if you've never seen one before I'm sure I can definitely find one um so like for example this is a directory yell.com and all it is is it's basically just linking through to your website it's got maybe a little bit of a business description it's talking about like the services that you actually offer um and then it obviously just points through to your actual website so


00:03:01        if we actually click this link here it goes through to your website now in a lot of cases directories can be like no follow links so in this case I'm using like a Chrome extension which tells me which links are do follow and which links are no follow but this red dotted line basically means that it is a no follow link now the good thing about directories that people might think oh why why don't I just get do followback links or why don't I just go and get like five links from the BBC or fors or


00:03:30        whatever right the good thing about these types of links is that you're actually being seen alongside all of your other competitors so for example Emergen emergency dentist Manchester s ESP Patel and Associates a Ceramics limited these are all of our competitors websites now if Google doesn't see our website alongside these competitors they might not know or understand what we do or who we are or where where we are either as well so it's all always really important to actually get these directories now


00:04:03        I'm going to show you guys two different methods to get directories this first method is going to be super manual it's going to be a long process the second method is going to be way less time consuming to the point where you could even just automate this and actually give it to like a VA or just hire someone to actually build out the citations now previously what I would used to do and this is the old way of how I used to build citations is I would go into a refs I would click on competitive analysis here


00:04:31        and then I would select referring domains and I would then paste in my free competitors right so I'm just going to play paste in like um what I will do is I'll just do Kasra d. co.uk right it's completely made up website but let's just say that's our website and then I would go and find free competitors that are also ranking for this keyword so this is the keyword that I want to rank for dentists in Manchester or lawyers in New York or whatever the keyword is right one thing to bear in mind as well is when you're


00:05:04        picking out your competitors this really important don't just look at like for example b. co.uk for any of the UK guys you'll understand kind of why I'm I'm ignoring these guys but for the American people that are watching this bua is like the um it is the private healthc care that like a lot of um companies just sign up to so like this website's like going to be a huge massive website so it's not directly a competitor however Manchester Dental practice. co.uk they are a competitor so um same goes with like the NHS the NHS is like


00:05:38        the government Health Organization in the UK so again I'm just going to ignore those guys and I'm going to go to the valence Dental center.com right and again I'm just going to paste in these guys and this will basically tell me like hey you've got x amount of links missing so if I actually do like at least three competitors so all three of my competitors actually have these links you'll see that it's only nine so you may actually want to lower this to at least two and as saying like 32 referring domains and basically you


00:06:11        would then go into each one so um this is yel Click get a free listing fill out this contact info or the the actual business listing it will actually ask you for a few more questions like your opening hours where you're based etc etc and then you would basically get a free listing now there's also Al paid listings as well which I will go into um in just a second because some people think they should pay for all of their directories and highly don't recommend that but basically that's the entire


00:06:42        process from start to finish you're going to go into each of these websites and actually get a link from them so for example if I go to like city maps. um let's just see consent so how do I actually fill in the form for this s see this is the slight issue when you're using ahfs the other method is going to be way easier you're not going to waste as much time actually filling out the contact form but there will be like somewhere on these websites where you can just fill out the form and get listed for free um


00:07:20        like web wiki. co.uk is another one as well you can just click on ADD website now very quickly right if you are contemplating potentially paying for a listing this is what I recommend like for example yell.com they have a free version they've also got a paid version what I recommend is instead of just saying like yeah I'm going to pay for it whether it's like20 a month or £1 a month or what whatever the case is it depends try to F find a directory that's actually ranking for the keyword now I'm


00:07:54        I'm going to just shoot off a couple CU I know that these rank but like if I search for like new or lawyers in New York right and this if any of you guys are like an agency or whatever some of you guys might actually decide to use this as an upsell tactic for some of your clients but take a look at this right lawyers in New York as you can see justia.com that is actually a directory site best lawyers.com that's also a directory site America's top 50 lawyers.com and all also another directory site


00:08:33        and is this a directory site or is this a government website this is like more of a government website um there's usually another one as well lawyers.in law is the other one I'm thinking of right so these four websites or these f one two these four websites actually rank fairly well for the keywords that lawyers would also want to try and rank for so I always recommend people actually search to see if the directory gets traffic that's when I would potentially contemplate actually paying for a premium listing because in some cases


00:09:12        right if your SEO campaign's going really well what might end up happening is jusa might be number one and you might be able to rank number three like if I was to search like lawyers in San FR Cisco for example let's see if we can get like a listing like that so you've got for example again in this case like yelp.com is ranking position free but let let's say for example if we were doing the SEO for leam and Walkins LLP right if I was the SEO for this company for example right and also in some cases


00:09:44        it's really difficult to actually outrank some of these directory sites especially if like you're a newer website and stuff but as a temporary fix what I would reach out to like the the marketing director of leam and Watkins and I would say hey you're currently ranking position fre why don't you just get a paid listing on justia.com cuz you're not you won't be losing clicks or you won't be losing leads at that point and in that case that would make sense but if justia.com for example just wasn't getting any traffic at all via


00:10:15        Google there's just no point paying for a paid listing so always track the kpis of the directors you you're getting but like if you take a look at this for example as you can see the average Impressions is just going up and up and up up like back in 2017 they were only getting 63 23,000 uh Impressions now they're getting 7.5 million so in this case it probably would make sense to actually pay for a paid listing especially if like you're searching for like lawyers in London or lawyers in in Miami for


00:10:49        example in jusia is actually coming up let's actually just search to see lawyers in Miami yeah so in that case it would make sense to actually pay for paid listing the top three listings here are all actually directories you've got just the OB best lawyers find law but in some cases that might not be the case and if you don't see any directories there's just probably no point in paying for the paid version of that directory they're just going to be taking your money and you're not going to be getting any leads


00:11:19        or any traffic from that actual directory bear in mind like a Free Directory versus a paid directory the SEO value especially if it's not getting any traffic TR is the same so there's no point in getting up to let's say a 60 or A50 a month or $100 a month package on a paid directory especially if that directory just isn't getting any traffic now this is the process this is the old process that I was using so I would plug in my competitors and I would say like okay these are the 30 um referring domains or these are the 30


00:11:52        directories that I need now this is the more improved version right so you can sign up to locallo it is completely complely free to use um especially if you want to use this section so plug in your actual profile here you can add it in manually or you can import your profile as well I've already added in too but what we can actually do is we can click on our gmbb profile and if you click on the citations section right it will give you a list of citations that you actually need and um so it will first of all tell


00:12:31        you like which ones are actually active so if I click on yell.com for example um I I'm going to assume that my gmbb is actively listed on this page let me just double check one second so as you can see clean fresh it's actually active and the good thing about this is it will actually give you like a to-do list so for example foursquare.com that's like another pretty big directory out in the UK you can actually just click that and it will take you to the page to actually get registered and claim your listing


00:13:04        and stuff like that so you can do that for any one of these like for example freeindex do.uk again it's another one now the good thing about this tool as well is that it will send you directly to the actual page to register so for example this is for cleanfresh do cleanfresh UK you can literally just fill it out um fill out the actual detail so it's a limited company the main business PRI uh category so this would be like cleaning and you've got your actual website your landline telephone so on


00:13:40        and so forth so any one of these actual um citations that you actually click on it should send you through to the actual registration page so you're not just like searching around so again this is the for/ claim section and you've got two or three pages like every single one of of these directories as well to my knowledge index very well so that's another thing when it comes to actually getting your citations crawled and indexed the next step would be to get all of these and bear in mind you can


00:14:14        actually like move these to being like done or move these to being ignored if you already have them but once you've got every single one now in this case as is shown us like 30 citations that we actually need but once you've got them all done I would highly recommend running them through like an indexing tool as well CU that will actually help Google crawl them and actually give your website more of a link equity and more link power as well so one last thing as well I really want to show you guys the


00:14:41        actual power of this tool because in this case this website here it's actually telling us that we need 131 citations now it's actually categorized them into like 82 that we already have and they're visible on Google one that we've actually lost as well so in this case case we might actually want to decide to reclaim this page um especially if it's not being like crawled or anything like that or if it's not being indexed so in that case we might decide to reindex this using like Giga index or or um Omega indexer


00:15:16        and stuff like that but it's also telling us like 48 that we actually need so for example we've not got a Facebook page we've not got an Instagram page we don't have an A LinkedIn page Apple Maps which again this is like really important especially because like so many people use iPhones but making certain that your business is registered on Apple Maps as well so again going through all of these will definitely help there's over just over 10 pages I believe or sorry there's 50 results or 48 results that we need actually listed


00:15:49        so like for example health. co.uk but once you actually have all of these listed you'll very quickly start seeing results especially if you've been following along in the uh local SEO playlist as well so that's been the video I hope you guys have enjoyed this this is a little bit of a timec consuming task especially if you're going to do this yourself what I would recommend doing is just getting this entire list and maybe even sending it out to like a VA or hiring someone to actually go and fill it all out for you


00:16:23        cuz that's probably going to be the most um it's probably going to give you the biggest bang for your book when it comes to the actual rankings and stuff like that especially if you've been building out your topical Authority if you've been building out the service Pages if you've been building out the local landing pages like what I've been showing you guys in the previous videos as well and if you guys do want help with your SEO check out car.com fill in the contact form and I will be in touch


00:16:49        thanks for watching


--------------------------------------------


00:00:01        so today I'm going to be showing you guys a very simple prompt to actually improve your content especially if like you are ranking position like 5 10 15 right this is going to help you um improve your content massively and it's very very simple to do it doesn't require any paid tools it doesn't require anything like that all you need is just chat gbt I'm using 40 which I believe is free but you could also use like the if if this isn't free you could also definitely use like 3.0 and stuff like that as well uh so the website that


00:00:35        we're going to be looking at is affen x.com so this is a website here it's doing pretty well uh it's getting 800,000 traffic every single month and if you guys have never heard of this website it's all to do with becoming an athlete um supplements different gym workout regimen stuff like that and it's very much in like the the fitness industry so a lot of the articles that they actually upload is to do with like the best workouts for your back or the best workouts for abs etc etc so that's the website that we're


00:01:10        going to be looking at in this video also very quickly if you guys do like this video and if you want to learn more about SEO or maybe even you've got an SEO agency you want to get in more clients head over to the mastermind.com we actually have a conference on the 27th of June 2025 in Manchester you can actually get the likes of Craig Campbell Lara Costa James dly carry Rose and many others um actually speaking in person so if you want to learn more about SEO head over to the mastermind.com grab your


00:01:44        tickets while you can so this is the page that we're going to be looking at in this video and this is to do with like the best lore chest workout but this actual sop or this training video would work for literally any type of website or any type of blog right but the whole purpose of this is we want to first of all search the keyword that we are in position like nine or 10 or whatever for right and we want to pick the one that's actually ranking number one uh based off of the content now in some cases you


00:02:20        might need to go through like four or five different blogs to find the actual true blog article that's winning based off content now that might sound really weird to some of you guys because in some cases websites or Pages might actually rank because they've got better links but in this case I would actually probably look and or in this case I would actually probably say that position number one actually truly does have the best content um it's got a lot of different actual uh gifts that you can actually


00:02:52        play and it also goes into details about like the different types of actual your chest and stuff like that so in this case we are are a little bit lucky because position number one I feel like as an SEO looking at it and also as a user looking at it this was like the the best content piece now the reason why I say that is if we were to go to like position number one two three 4 five let's say right it's very um easy to understand that this isn't the best article mainly because it's just make big massive wall of content and they've


00:03:28        not really use like Unique Images and stuff like that and it it just isn't as well formatted to say the least right but in this case what all I'm going to do is I'm just going to copy this actual content so all of this content I'm just going to copy it all and we're going to stick this into chat gbt and we're going to give it the prompt that we want to actually use right so we will just copy all of this and we'll also even copy the references everything right so we'll just copy that and we're going to head over to chat gbt this is


00:04:05        the prompt uh all I've done is I've just said can you analyze this article is ranking for best lower chest workouts right and then I've just pasted the content in and then right at the bottom I've said can you give me a list of 25 secondary keywords and lsis that I need to include in my article and we're just going to let this do its thing it might take a couple minutes because it is a little bit of a longer article uh um but as you can see here we've got a load of actual secondary keywords to include in our


00:04:37        article this is based off of what's already ranking and as you can see for example you've got the likes of lower chest exercises chest muscle autonomy um decline bench press now again if any of you guys have aren't that into the gym and stuff like that like the the one of the best workouts you can do for your lower chest area is actually the decline bench breast um you've got the dips incline push-ups for chest so on and so forth so as you can see here we've actually got a list of secondary keywords or LSI some people call them to


00:05:14        actually include in our article now what we're also going to do as well is we're going to actually run this through phase or phrase should I say um and we're going to get a list and see if we uh best lower chest workout we're going to basically Al get an SEO score for our content and we're just going to let this do its thing now if you've never used phrase before it basically gives you like an SEO score of which you should aim for when it comes to ranking and writing your actual content so basically


00:05:44        it'll tell us like which keywords to actually include and stuff like that now you don't need to use this but all I wanted to do is just use it to see what the SEO score of the page is and to also paste in these secondary keywords that uh chat gbts given us as well so going to let it do its thing and we're going to come back to in just a second so this is what it actually has come back with and if we actually look at the right hand side you've got like decline bench um starting position cable machine chest


00:06:16        workout so on and so forth so all I'm going to do is I'm just going to paste in the keywords that chat gbt um gave us and as you can see here just by alone just having the keywords on the page we've actually went from a score of 1% to 25% and again or sorry 21% now this is with no additional content like I wouldn't just recommend just pasting in the keywords that chat gbt's given us what you obviously want to do is make certain that the content is actually well written it's got sentences um so on


00:06:51        and so forth but that's like a really good place to start off with especially if you've already um kind of ranking for a keyword so this this case we're going to use like the the website that we were looking at before right so this website here um is Rank and position number five I believe let me just take a look um one two three 4 five six so it's actually rank in position number six in Google right so what we can actually do here is if we just P copy all of this content we're just going to paste into


00:07:30        phrase and to see what kind of SE score it's actually going to throw out um so quite a big article actually and if we just copy all of this we will delete all of the keywords that uh chat gbt gave us as you can see it's given us like a 45 score uh one thing that is that we are actually um doing poorly of and I know that fras is saying that this is a good thing is our article is 6,196 words the average is 1,200 so we are a little bit of an outlier there what I always recommend especially if you're like looking at at certain things


00:08:16        like this is does it make sense to be 6,100 words especially if everybody else is so much lower than yours could you lower your word count and provide the exact same value if the case is yes then definitely cuz another thing you don't want to make certain that you're doing is you don't want to be playing hide and seek with your content right now what I mean by that is take a look at your content now in this case this is like way too much too many words but if somebody has to scroll past like 4 and a half thousand


00:08:50        words to get to their answer you're playing hideand-seek with your content so if you can decrease the word count and provide the exact same value as what you are currently doing then it's a much better ranking article so now that we've actually got that out the way and also one thing that I will do is let me just copy this and paste this obviously you would you wouldn't just paste in the the keywords you would actually try to work them in through the actual article but right now we're at 45 out of 100 the


00:09:20        average is 36 by the way so this content is not terrible um but it could definitely be improved but if we just add in all the keywords that chat gbt gave us Bas off of the person that is actually ranking position one we've actually went to 55 out of 100 so that's another thing to bear in mind as well like make certain that you are working in lsis and if you don't know what an LSI is I'll very quickly go through it with you so LSI stands for latent semantic indexing and basically it's it's a simple way of Google


00:09:54        understanding what the page is about um I might actually do a video on this but basically it is how Google scores a page as to how relevant that page is for the primary keyword right so if you only have or let's say we we go back to the actual um best lower chest workout scenario right if you only just have the best low chest workout in your content once and you don't mention for example decline bench press and you don't mention pectoral muscles and you don't mention the keyword muscle muscles Google is


00:10:31        slightly uncertain what that page is about even though you've only just mentioned this phrase once in your keyword you need to have all of the other lsis for that page to rank and do well now ultimately the best content has all of the ls or maybe not all of the lsis but has the most lsis out of everybody else so you just want to make certain when you are trying to rank your content you're have you're including as many lsis that's relevant to that page so for example if we go back to this page right and if we take a look at some of


00:11:07        the keywords so best lower chest workout that's obviously the main keyword that we want to rank for but for example dips or dip plus um and all of these different exercises would be lsis to do with best low chest workout so in this case I would be looking to actually include these in my AR like decline cable dip um nailing Express for example straight bar dip all of those are basically um lsis and again it can be a little bit difficult especially if you don't know the industry or the niche that you're talking about sometimes you


00:11:47        can or you can or you should use tools like phrase and chat gbt to help do and complete your research as well but that's my been my video it's really simple prompt that you can actually use um on chat gbt to give you more lsis to actually include on your page if you guys have enjoyed this video please remember to leave a like and as always if you want help with your SEO check out kard dash.com and fill in the contact form and I will be in touch thanks for watching

00:00:00        so this video is for people that have already been doing their topical Authority maybe you've already even been doing your link build inside of stuff but you're still not seeing your results so buy the books you've already done everything you feel like and maybe you're already ranking position 10 15 20 you're just not in the top three spots yet so this is going to cover what I feel like might be one of the biggest issues that I see on consultancy calls and when people like say to me like hey can you just do a quick audit on my


00:00:32        website this is probably the number one biggest outlying issue that we're going to cover in today's video it shouldn't even take me that long to go over and you only need one tool to actually do this but very quickly if you guys haven't check out the masterm minders this is a in-person SEO conference that's happening on the 27th of June in Manchester you've got the likes of Craig Campbell speaking Lara Costa James dly Carrie Rose and many many more speaking as well so if you haven't already grab


00:01:02        your tickets well you can and yeah let's get into the video so first of all I'm obviously going to need to find a website that is suffering from this so I'm just going to find the website very quickly and I'll show you guys step by step how to do this right so all I've done is I have found a website that's ranking not terribly bad obviously it's nowhere near the the moneymaking spot uh they are position one two 3 three four five 6 so they are position 26 we are on page three so 26 uh page three of Google


00:01:39        position 26 there we go and as we can see here they've got a page here and obviously the the the content on this page could definitely be improved now we're not going to necessarily take a look at the content today because I've done tons of videos on how to improve your content um and what to look at out for and stuff like that but let's say in this scenario right this this website has got perfect content and I know like I could probably go through a loot of different other um Pages or um actual


00:02:14        sites here that do have way better content in these guys and are ranking at a much lower position like if we open up like page four for example and take a look at um Hogan ls.com right the the content on this page again it's not terrible it's not great but it's not terrible right but in this case let's just pretend for a second that this content is Su optimized it is for Google Google understands it you've got all the subheadings you've got all the questions stuff like that what we then want to do right is just


00:02:46        copy this website and go over to screaming frog now I've already done this um but if you um basically I've never used screaming frog I believe it is free for the first 500 you URLs um but this is what it looks like once it does open there we go it it does look like a little bit of an ugly tool but I will show you guys how to actually process the information that spits out at you cuz I do understand that in some cases it can be very daunting looking at this tool especially if you've never used it before um but as you can see


00:03:21        here right this is basically crawling the entire website and it's given us a load of information like um how many pages are on the website are the pages indexable by Google um what the status code is it just tells you all of that information and it can be a little bit of a um cluster if you have never used it before but all I'm going to do is I'm just going to pause the video for just a second and we're going to come back to the video once it's finished crawling you'll be able to see once it has


00:03:54        finished crawling um and I believe the free version of this tool will allow for 500 URL so as long as your website isn't more than 500 pages you should be fine otherwise I think you need to pay like 60 $70 which I highly recommend doing because it's kind of like the Swiss army knife when it comes to uh running Audits and analyzing your website also I may have said f $50 a month I believe it's like $70 for the entire year just as a as a side note so if we actually take a look here it's actually finished the crawl on on


00:04:30        screaming frog now there's a couple filters that we're going to actually apply so it's just a little bit easier to actually look at the data right so by default on screaming frog if you click on the left hand side here what you want to do is just select HTML so it's only going to show the HTML Pages um that are readable and accessible by Google right and as you can see here we've got our page that is the New York lawyer page that we're just looking at before if I actually just open this on my browser


00:05:04        section here as you can see this is the page that we're looking at the one that's not ranking um high enough and if we take a look here at unique in links now I do have my column set up slightly a little bit different um but if we take a look in in your case you might just need to like scroll over to the right hand side over here right um but in my instance I've actually got it peled off all the way over to the left and this basically basically tells us how many internal links this page actually has going


00:05:38        through to it now as a rule of f the more unique in links that your page actually has you're telling Google like hey this page is really important to me uh you need to be basically visiting this page more you need to be um giving this page more internal link Equity as well so for example right in this case we've got pages that are 31 or they have 31 unique in links this page here which is like a pretty reasonably uh important page for us it actually has 21 unique in links which tells me straight from the


00:06:15        word go that we need more internal links being built through to this page now you can also take a look at like the word count of a page as well so in this case 1,2 words it might be a little bit slim for this style of page so in that case I would actually maybe give it to my content writer to rewrite that page as well also another thing to bear in mind that this tool does really well is that it will tell you where your internal links are actually coming from so if I actually just click on to the page that


00:06:45        we're analyzing right we can click on in links down below and it will tell us which Pages we are getting our internal links from so if I was to click or go to this page here for example and it will also tell us the anchor that it's also using as well so like it's just using the anchor New York so what an anchor looks like is this basically so on the sidebar now what we would actually want to do when we're trying to increase our amount of unique in links is you want to include the internal link throughout your actual


00:07:24        content and what I mean by that is navbar links so links that are within your navigation bar at the top links that are in your sidebar and links that are in your footer for example those are always links that are given less of an actual page rank value whereas if we were to actually include a link like this here like learn about more rankings here so if this said for example New York Lawyers and it was going through to our New York Lawyers page because this is deemed as being mainbody content Google will actually


00:07:59        pass more internal link power through to our New York page so that's one thing that I would be looking at doing also analyze where your unique in links are coming from at the minute as well so if we take a look at this page here so as you can see here um can I zoom in I can't actually zoom in but it tells us on the left hand side from so which pages are linking to our New York page so in this case we've got a lot of actual duplicates it's actually probably not as many internal links as we actually think because if we take a look


00:08:37        here right we actually have got um oh where's that actually gone there we go so if we take a look as you can see we've got one two three one two 3 4 5 6 7 8 nine we've got about 10 links pointing from the exact same page we want as many different blog art Les as many different service pages that obviously makes sense pointing through to our New York page so obviously analyze to see if it makes sense keep that internal link if it doesn't you might want to actually remove that internal Link and Link from a more


00:09:15        relevant page but that's basically what um a good internal Linkin structure should look like I'll also show you guys one website that's doing very well when it comes to their internal linking strategy so this is a Blog set ction of an e-commerce store that's doing really well and this is like one of their blogs on how to refill a vape kit right now in this case this page probably doesn't actually earn them that much money but what they have been able to do is strategically internal link to for example their new Vape kit page and in


00:09:47        this case they do actually earn money from actually internal linking and trying to rank this page and this is the similar thought process that you should have to your website like for example if you're a lawyer right if you've got an article on um how much does a divorce cost how much does a divorce cost right let's try and find an actual Law Firm so these guys right cost of a divorce in UK now this article should internally link to their divorce attorney or divor divorce solicitor's page which they actually have done


00:10:22        they're actually internally linking to their homepage so that's how you should be structuring your internal links and making the most out of your internal linking strategy but obviously don't just go in blind use a tool like screaming frog analyze where your internal links are currently coming from and where they should be um going to as well so that's been this video on internal Linkin and also how to obviously maximize your onpage SEO if you guys have enjoyed this video please remember to leave a like and if you want

--------------------------------


00:00:01        so today I'm going to be going over why websites don't rank we're going to be basically breaking down a technical Su audit on a site and I'm going to highlight things that could potentially be holding your website back and things that you should be looking out for especially if you have started to scale out a website or maybe you've already started scaling out your website and your website just isn't ranking where you feel like it should be it might be something to do with the technical SEO side of it very quickly if you guys


00:00:30        haven't already purchased tickets to the masterm minders it's happening on the 27th of June hosting a in-person SEO and also business conference in Manchester and you've got the likes of Craig Campbell speaking about website flipping you've got Lara Costa talking about lead generation for agencies so if you've got an agency and you're trying to scale out more inquiries she's probably the go-to person you've got James dly talking about lead generation Carrie Rose talking digital PR and many many more so let's get into it now what


00:01:04        I'm going to B basically be doing is I'm going to find a website that isn't ranking so well and we're going to be running it through a tool called screaming frog you will need this tool I believe you can run 500 pages through it for free if you have a bigger website you might need to pay for the actual package which I think it's like $100 or $70 for the year highly recommend getting it it's quite a useful tool so what I am going to do is I'm just going to search for HVAC company in Orlando just a random keyword and we're


00:01:38        going to pick uh we'll pick these guys so one thing that we're going to very quickly do is make certain that it's not a huge website these guys seem like they are massive uh the reason why I'm picking quite a small website because it's going to take a lot less time to actually run the audit um using screaming frog so bear with me for just a second so this is the website that we're going to be looking at they are called far.com and they are bottom of page two so they're not in a terrible position by


00:02:13        any means but they're also not going to be generating any inquiries for that keyword which was HVAC company in Orlando right so we're just going to run a technical audit and see what their issues are so this has finished the actual audit basically what this tool does if you've never used it before is it will actually crawl your entirety of your website and we basically highlight any issues that you've got now if you've never used it before it can be a little bit daunting uh but we're going to be


00:02:46        looking at the data that actually does push the needle so all I'm going to do is I'm going to select HTML and I might actually even set up a Google sheet for this just so we can actually um highlight all the issues so all of done is I've just created a blank sheet and what we're going to do is on the status codes we first of all want to make certain that there are no 404s or double 301s it looks like we do actually have some so all I'm going to do is I'm just going to highlight all of these and I'm


00:03:16        just going to export this so I don't know if you guys saw that right but if I don't um select anything there's nothing in this uh URL selected area but if I actually select all of these so as we can see here we have got 404 error and as you can see here this is the actual uh anchor text now the more pages that I obviously select the more issues that we actually have here so all I'm going to do is I'm going to select all the 404 pages and the 301 Pages basically these are pages that are have an error and you'll


00:03:55        obviously be able to tell that is if you've got status code here and then you've got the state so these are all moved per permanently 200 error basically means that they're that it's fine it's an okay page so I'm just going to click on export we're going to do fan services uh errors so we're just going to click on Save and we will do file import and we will select upload and we'll just click and drag the actual issues here so we've got the double 404 or the double 301s we'll also click on append so as we can see here right I


00:04:42        will just color code this a little bit so it's a little bit easier to actually see I'll also reduce the size of my face so if I just select this as being like gray and this being as green for example and this we'll select as being Orange so this is the page that the actual error lies on so if we actually go to that page and if we uh copy the anchor text as you can see this is a link going through to a page that 301's as you can see here uh what I will do as well is I'll show you guys what it looks like


00:05:22        when it's a 404 error so this is the page that's coming from and this is the anchor text and if we take look here right if we click on this this goes to 404 page so if we've got too many 404 Pages or if we have double 301s it can mess with our crawl budget because Google needs to go to a page then go to another page like um one tool that I recommend for you guys to use is the redirect path uh if you guys don't have this is what looks like let me just redirect path Google Chrome extension this is what it looks like if


00:06:03        you want to get the actual tool but this basically tells you like which Pages it goes through to first so as we can see we clicked the link so this page is fine but we actually clicked the link reducing facing and it went through to one page which then redirected to the page that we are currently on so it looks like this website potentially might have changed URL structures and not fully cleaned up their previous internal Linkin so that's one thing that we would be looking at and fixing on our website and it's all to do with just


00:06:40        literally just going in and fixing all of these URLs and making certain there's no double 301s or we're not that internally linking to a 404 page so we going to rename this tab to 301s and 404s now this website's not got that many let me just see it's actually got 105 so this would be a clear indicator as to um some pages as to why they're not ranking now let's go back to screaming frog and see what else that we can actually pinpoint so any pages that have got a low word count those would be pages that I would be looking at as well


00:07:18        to just basically um improve the actual um word count and make certain that we've actually got SE optimized content now first things for first we want to only make certain that we're looking at pages that obviously have got a 200 status code as you can see here we've got like a false positive in the sense that this page is shown as being zero word count but if we actually go to it this is our 404 page as you guys remember that we looked at a couple seconds ago so what we would actually want to do is head over to the search


00:07:55        section here and click on search terms and what we want to do is we want to make certain that the status code contains 200 and we're going to click on okay now we're actually seeing pages that have got low word count so for example window film photography this only has 400 um 400 words or sorry 630 words so as you can see here actually this is sorry my bad this is a gallery page which in that case it would make sense for it to actually have low word count but if we were to keep going through our Pages


00:08:36        obviously we've sorted by word count lowest to highest so duck list installation is another page for example right this page here it's got an okay amount of words is it enough to rank probably not so in this case I would probably look to actually further improve this page so what I would do is search the keyword that we're obviously trying to rank for which is Duck lless installation and look at the people also search so obviously make certain that we've actually got these questions on the page which it doesn't look like we


00:09:08        do what is duck lless installation how much does it cost to have duck lless installation so I'll just do cost for example and they don't actually have it in a subheading can I install duck lless AC myself that would be another question so including the people also ask questions looking at who's ranking positions 1 2 and three seeing uh what kind of content that they actually have what type of subheadings they actually have and making certain that we actually include those on our page um so that would be


00:09:39        another thing that I would do again you can just export a list of these pages and actually create like it sorry export the list of pages and obviously import it into our sheet as to which pages should be getting worked on now again with this exact same status code applied what we want to take a look at is the pages with the least amount of internal links going through to them right so if we take a look here as we can see we have got a page which is talking about Winter Park Florida and I'm guessing so these guys


00:10:21        want to rank for air conditioned installations in Winter Park Florida right now I don't even need to Google this page but I'm going to assume or I'm not going to assume I'm going to guess that this page isn't ranking so air [Music] conditioning install Winter Park Florida let's take a look and see where they actually rank so they're not on page one we'll do they are on page number three and it's not the correct page that's ranking either it's the homepage that's ranking so in this case it looks like Google


00:11:00        doesn't know which page to rank for and which page not to rank right now what I would be looking to do here is improve the amount of unique in links that this page actually has cuz right now it only has the one obviously it'll have navbar links going through to it but it's not got enough internal links so what I would be looking at doing is make building out more blog content or if this website actually does have a lot of blog content making certain that we are actually internally linking through to


00:11:32        the Winter Park Florida page which would mean that this page here would in eventually d rank so our homepage would go down but our Winter Park Florida page would be the page that would end up ranking correctly like what these other Pages have started to do so if we look at our competitors right it's never uh the homepage that actually ranks for it is the actual Winter Park Florida page and the reason for the reason why our website isn't ranking the correct page is because our in actual Winter Park


00:12:05        Florida page doesn't have enough internal links going through to it so that would be one thing that I would be looking at fixing look seems like they have got a lot of these Pages like Windmere is another location that isn't ranking for that keyword and as we can see here we only have got one unique in link so again I would probably make certain that I would obviously take a look and see which how many pages there are it looks like there's 114 Pages overall the more unique in links that you have going through to a page you're


00:12:40        basically telling Google like hey this page is important to me please rank this page higher so again what I'm going to do here is anything that's got like less than 10 internal links I'm just going to create a list of pages on my Google sheet to build more internal links is so unique internal Links Page URL also another thing as well to worth mentioning if you're ever uncertain about like which anchors to use to point to this page go into your Google search console and look to see what kind of keyword you're actually showing up for


00:13:25        and use those as actual internal link anchors you could also do this using AHS but but I'm going to assume that this page doesn't show up for anything yeah it's not showing up for anything at all um let's see if we can actually find a page that is ranking for some secondary keywords um so this page here this is their Dynamic window tinting page and this also had one unique internal link going through to it but look at all of these secondary keywords so they've got Dynamic window tin Dynamic window


00:13:56        tinting window tin Port um orange adaptive window tint so anything that's obviously anything that is obviously relevant to the page I would actually include as an internal link anchor from a Blog article or from a different service page and that helps theme this page and it basically helps Google understand what this page is actually about so now that we have covered double 301's 404 pages and also the internal Link in for the actual website we're going to then take a look at the at the images on this website


00:14:39        because that's also another thing that can potentially hold the website back so what we're going to do is we're going to go over to images and we're going to take a look and see if there are any images that um are missing any attributes so if we take a look here right um if you actually go to I don't know if you guys saw what I just done there but if you guys click through to images here you will then be displayed with images that have got over 100 kilobytes in size which basically means that images that haven't


00:15:18        been lowered in actual size or um optimized in size for SEO so for example if you're uploading like massive images from your DSLR for example that can slow your website down and potentially increase bounce rate just a little bit so just be wary of that if you do have any huge images I know that some um e-commerce stores upload images direct from their DSLR and their dslrs taking images in 4k and stuff like that so just bear this in mind just have a run through any images that are potentially um too big so for example


00:15:55        like 400 402 kilobytes in size that's like a huge image or yeah this is like too big um so I would look to actually optimize that you can use tools like tiny PNG for example tiny PNG you can process all of your images another thing that's quite um important when it comes to your actual images as well is making certain that you're actually naming your images like these guys they've just got looks like they're just uploading it direct from like their phone or whatever but if we actually take a look here there's


00:16:28        like 2021 0182 61152 42. jpeg what you want to make certain that you're doing is if this is like for example a window tint that they've actually done I'm I'm not certain what this is right but let's say it's a window ENT you want to make certain that you're actually naming it correctly so you're naming it like window ENT um in Florida or in KMI Orlando uh jpeg or. PNG like let me show you good example of images so this is a good example and as you can see here featured so I'm guessing this is like


00:17:07        the featured image but they've actually got the name of what they're trying to rank the image for so how to start heating and ventilation business. jpeg so this is what you should be doing with your actual nameing structure when it comes to your images never just upload it as being 552 678 92. PNG cuz it's just very you're making it really difficult for Google to understand first of all what the image is for and second of all actually ranking it so again if you take a look at like any high ranking


00:17:36        website they should be doing that so as you can see here this is the image name is called how to start a hfac business. JPEG as well so always just make certain that you're naming your actual images um especially if you care about ranking your images that's like really important then you've got the missing alt text so basically when Google is crawling that web that web page does it understand what that image is actually about so they have got a lot of images that just don't actually have a um alt tag so


00:18:15        209% of their images don't have an ALT tag um at all so basically 30% so that's some things that you should also worry about when it comes to your page as well so then we're going to take a look at externals so one thing that you can also do as well when it comes to this is obviously just export as you go so obviously the sheet that we created the next tab here would obviously be like the images tab so we'll just call this images and we would export this um so anything that is missing the alt tag we would obviously just export


00:18:54        all of these um I'll tag missing so basically go back through and add an ALT tag to those and any images that are more than 100 kilobyte as well so again that's 47% of their images so 40% of their IM 47% of their images basically need to be optimized so optimize images we'll just paste those in there and then if I'm being honest with you guys I would probably just re upload all of their images especially if you're going to be optimizing them and stuff like that with the correct naming structure cuz the nameing structure on


00:19:37        these images is completely diabolical like there's very few images that have been a named properly like for example air duct 02 after so I'm going to assume that that's probably an air duct yeah um again it's not the best image there but you should be naming your your actual files uh when you're uploading them so then got the external section so again we will create a external tab here now basically what this external tab on screaming frog shows us is websites that our website is linking out to but it is showing a bad


00:20:18        air uh status code so obviously we've done this internally so when we're linking to certain pages and stuff like that um it tells us like hey you've got double 401 or if a sorry a double 301 and a 404 but sometimes websites link out to reliable sources and those reliable sources sometimes um change their website URL structure and stuff like that so for example they to be fair they don't actually have many but rgf.com they're actually linking to and we're just going to open up this website and we'll see what it is actually about


00:20:53        um so this looks like a Environmental Group Inc so this I don't know maybe it's it's a A supplier that they use something along those lines but they are actually double 301 and when they are actually linking out to them same goes with their Twitter URL so they might have changed their Twitter URL um same goes with like sign now and they also link out to their Google review uh URL which again double 302s um so in that case I would be fixing some of these URLs there are also if you saw by lowest to highest you can


00:21:31        actually see that they're trying to link to their CID URL which in some cases you might want to keep that um because it actually helps with like your Google Map Pack rankings and stuff but in some cases just filter through these URLs and make certain that it should be linking through to the URLs that you are obviously linking through to and that I believe also another thing that you can also do is well is head over to the H1 section and look to see if you've got any pages that are missing a H1 as well


00:22:06        so again you can sort by lowest to highest and you can see these Pages here that are all missing a H1 same goes with like H2 so this is more like a Content audit now so as you can see here you're very easily picking out the worst performing pages and you're going to actually perform some content audit on it same goes with like the content section as well you can sort buy lowest to highest so we've actually got three pages here uh that actually have low amount or zero scores uh when it comes to the word count then


00:22:41        you've got like 400 to do you know what anything less than a thousand I would actually be looking to to improve because those are typically pages that probably just need a little bit of further love now I'm not saying word count is the Beyond and end all but it's a good um place to start especially if you've just not done any further uh Su optimizations and stuff so that has been the video on a technical SE audit I hope you guys have enjoyed this video and as always if you guys do want a strategy call with myself maybe


00:23:13        you're struggling to rank or maybe you just need an expert to take a look at your website and give you some suggestions check out cash.com fill in the contact form and like what I mentioned at the start of this video If you guys haven't head over to the mastermind.com and grab your tickets for the inperson SEO conference that's happening on the 27th of June thanks for watching


------------------------------------------


00:00:00        so today I am going to be talking about a super duper boring subject especially if you're more of an advanced SEO you'll probably sick to death about hearing about this but today I'm going to be talking about Silo structure and the correct way of setting up a website now this is like a very commonly um asked about question in the actual SEO space I can't believe I've actually done about 400 videos now on my channel I've never actually fully spoke about Silo structures but here here we are um so we're going to be talking


00:00:33        about that also on the 27th of June in Manchester I am hosting a in-person SEO conference um we're going to be talking about business digital marketing um lead generation so you've got the likes of Craig Campbell talking about website flipping we've got the likes of Lara Costa talking about generating leads for your actual SEO agency using LinkedIn we've got James talking about lead generation Carrie Rose talking about digital PR and many many more speakers as well so if that sounds like something


00:01:04        you're interested in maybe you want to level up your Su knowledge head over to the mass reminders grab your ticket like I said it is happening on the 27th of June and then there is a mastermind um if you get that ticket that is happening on the 28th of June as well so let's talk about Silo structures so this is what typically 99% of su optimized websites look like you've got obviously the homepage up here which then internally links to like The Silo pages and then you've got the posts underneath so these


00:01:38        Silo Pages the these could be like if you're a local business for example these could be like services so these could be like um if you're a dentist let's say these could be like um Invisalign or if you're selling solar panels this could be like solar panel installation Specialist or if if you're doing kitchen remodeling it could be like um kitchen remodeling is is actal service right or if you're an e-commerce store these could be like for example this could be like the homepage and this might be let's say


00:02:11        um gray sofas and then these would be like your products right nothing really changes from local to to e-commerce and I know that sounds crazy saying that because they're two completely different style of websites but from an SEO point of view looking at it from a top down point of view this is exactly what I what a website looks like now what you should be looking at doing when it comes to your website Silo structure is you want to try and make as much topical Authority now if you are an e-commerce


00:02:43        store your topical Authority might come from your product pages if you're a local business your topical Authority might come from your blog articles in some cases there is a little bit of crossover for both like e-commerce stores still need blog articles which I will go into in just a second but any well- ranking website follows something similar to this there's obviously slightly different variances but this is like the the base level Foundation Silo structure that you should be looking at doing now I'm going


00:03:13        to show you guys like a local um SEO example and then I'll show you an e-commerce SE example just to show you that this is universal right so this website here it's ranking position number two for dentists in New York right now they obviously rank for a variety of different Services now these Services here are basically the actual Silo pages right so for example you've got um adult checkup digital x-rays uh mouth guards so um for example they are all on four dental implants right that is one Silo now if we were to take


00:03:53        a look and do a little bit of digging if we were to try and find more of their supporting blogs which is these post down here if we do like for example implants [Music] implants implants as you can see these are the blog articles and these are like the posts down here right so these are basically like the supporting articles um talking about um signs that you might need dental implants tips for dental dental implant recovery do dental implants function like natural teeth seven advantages of of dental implants


00:04:32        these are all just posts so these posts should be internally linking back up to our main Silo page or our main service page now if they also had like um location P based Pages as well which I think they might do um yeah they do so cosmetic gum reduction NYC right that is also another type of actual Silo page as well so there's a variety of different ways that this kind of like matches with with a website there's not really a right or wrong um but just remember that if you are trying to rank for a service like


00:05:12        for example if I was trying to rank for SEO services in Manchester right that would be the silo page up here and then I might do like SEO versus PPC um what type of budget does a Manchester based um business need for SEO that might be another post so on and so forth so those would be the support articles that would all internal link back up to my main service page the page that earns me the most money as a business now here is another example so this is like an e-commerce SEO example of um a actual


00:05:45        site Silo structure right so as we can see buy a sofa I think it was that I just searched so buy a sofa this would be or actually do you know what what we'll do is we'll do buy a gray sofa and we've got Furniture Village still ranking number one so in this case here right buy a gray sofa that would be our main Silo page up here and then we've also just got the products so the products would be our posts in this scenario that's how a a a silo structure works in terms of e-commerce now one thing as well to remember you can be


00:06:23        really crafty because you can actually also be uploading um blog articles to your e-commerce store as well so for example in this case I would be doing blog articles like um gray um living room ideas and then I would essentially internal link that to my um gray sofa's page as well so there's multiple ways that you can build out this topical Authority these posts are essentially if you're an e-commerce store these could be products if you're local business these could be blog articles that you upload to your news


00:06:55        section your blog section of your website but you just need to make certain that you're actually internally linking back up to your main Silo the page that generates you the most cash whether it's byra SAS or whether it's dental implants so that is how you should be structuring your Silo um for your website so in i' I've just tested out um this prompt here and this has actually done a relatively decent job when it comes to um the site Silo structure right so I've just used chat gbt 4 and I've said can you give me a


00:07:31        silo structure for the main keyword being dental implant so that is basically um this top page up here and can you also give me 10 supporting articles for that main keyword and this is what it's come back with right so subcategories SL supporting articles water dental implants yep I would probably um include that on the actual page or as a separate blog post down here then we've got benefits of dental implants that would be another blog post then we have got dental implants versus other Solutions so dental implants


00:08:05        versus what whatever else there is so we can actually search that and see what other recommendations there are dental implants yes so dental implants versus dentures that would be another blog article dental implants versus Bridge dental implant versus crowns root canal veneers partials braces all of these right there's probably like maybe 10 different blog posts s that we would have there caring for dental implants and advanced topics in dental implants this last one I'm a little bit uncertain


00:08:39        of but the top four here is pages that I would actually create on the blog section of my website so if you are ever uncertain of what you should be posting just use a simple prompt like that now I'm not saying it's going to come back being 100% perfect because this is like this one this last one here is um is something that I probably wouldn't include but these top four I would definitely include on my website so that's been my video on the best Silo structure there's nothing really crazy advanced in that it's just more so


00:09:14        cleaning or clearing up any questions you guys might have to do with that if you guys have enjoyed this video please remember to leave a like and like what I mentioned at the start if you want to be in the right room learning from the best in the industry head over to the master reminders.com or if you want to work with with me maybe you've got a website and you're struggling to rank it head over to cash.com fill in the contact form and I will be in touch thank you for watching

----------------------------------------




00:00:01        so today I'm going to be answering an ageold added question and that is do pbn's work it is very controversial some people would say yes some people would say no I'm going to be showing you guys some actual results that is from a very well- ranking website in the actual Casino industry and we're going to break down if they do work and if you are going to do it what you should also be very wary of as well because if you're going to be doing pbn link building kind of a black hat technique I'm not saying


00:00:35        you should I'm not saying you shouldn't I'm just going to show you guys the data so before we get into the video very quickly quick little plug the master reminders I'm hosting a in-person SE conference happening on the 27th of June and then a private Mastermind on the 28th of June if you are in Manchester or if you can fly to the event you're not going to want to miss this conference we've got the likes to Craig Campbell speaking speaking about um flipping websites so buying a website for a smaller multiple


00:01:05        and then selling it for a higher multiple you've got the likes of Lara Costa talking about generating leads for your actual SEO agency so if you're an agency owner she's probably going to be the one that you want to listen to we've got the likes of James dly talking about lead gen so if you're trying to generate more leads for your actual business he's going to be your man then we've got Carri Rose talking about digital PR and we've got multiple other speakers as well so you don't want to miss it head


00:01:30        over to to the mastermind.com grab your tickets well you can now this is the website that we're going to be looking at this website is pretty much I want to say like maybe 40% of its backlink profile is powered up by pbns and it ranks relatively well for a lot of slot related keywords so like for example High Roller slots any of the I gaming people you'll know that high roller slots is a very um good earn good earning keyword because again somebody that's searching for high roller slots they want to deposit a lot


00:02:07        they want to essentially play with a lot of money on um slot sites so they actually rank number one for high roller slots in the UK and as you can see they've not been around for that amount of years maybe like three or four years um and they've been able to grow from literally zero to just over 20 wait where is the actual traffic value $5,000 traffic value which is a little bit low on um on HFS because it's it's in the slots or the casino Niche um but they're getting about two 2 and a half thousand hits a month so what are they


00:02:46        actually doing if we take a look at their backlink profile so here's their backlink profile it's not even that powerful of pbns but as we can see here they've got like a load of different um domain names that they've actually purchased so like top offer place number one top offer places Heaven number one offers and these are all just pbn's linking through to their actual website so they've got a few different um websites one thing that they're actually doing which is quite smart and I'll show you guys what I mean


00:03:19        by that in a diagram in just a second but they're using pbn to power up other pbn so if I actually open up a few of their pbns here right as you you can see these are all links to other pbns in the actual Network so they're using their pbn Network to power up other pbns um and what that looks like is I what I'll do is I'll I'll draw out in just a second so this is my really well-designed diagram um this is basically what they have done right so they've got their money site right at the top up here and they've got like maybe


00:03:57        10 15 20 different pbns and they all Interlink to one another so this pbn here this pbn here links to this pbn which then also links to this pbn as you can see from the actual arrows that I've actually been able to draw right so all of these pbns are powering up each other which then also Interlink or um backlink to the actual money site now the reason why they've been able to do this well is because every single pbn is is getting a new referring domain which means that the pbn are getting more back links but


00:04:35        they're also helping power up the actual money site at the top now I'm not going to say that this is like the strongest pbn Network that I've actually found because it's definitely not but it's doing the actual job like they've got um 12 referring domains to this one they've got 18 referring domains to this one 9 20 18 13 um what is this one is this another pbn this is another pbn 9 9 10 14 so it's not like a a crazy um pbn Network there's there's definitely more powerful pbn networks but let me tell you why


00:05:12        this is working so well because a lot of people think or they deem this has being blackout which it technically is I'm not going to deny that but the reason why this is working so well is because they've built their own pbn network so they've spent their own money and time building out this pbn network and interlinking it and all they do is they link to their own sites now there's a lot of pbn providers out there that will make this pbn network public and they'll try to sell you pbns and stuff like that


00:05:46        now in some cases the websites that I have actually audited in the past the pbns that they've been able to acquire from like public networks and stuff it's not actually um helped them that much it's more so a public blog Network as opposed to a private blog Network the whole purpose of a pbn network is that you are the owner and you don't sell any links on it but some people obviously do sell links on pbns and stuff and it can definitely have a negative impact so hence why some people are for pbn some


00:06:19        people are against pbns um just bear that in mind when it comes to doing any pbn or um link building so I've actually got a few questions when it comes to pbn I'm going to answer and hopefully by the end of this you will be able to make a decision of if pbn's is right for you so how do pbn's influence SEO pbn's basically um because you're powering these up and they're consistently getting more links they're basically becoming stronger um links for your uh money site so basically if if it's your


00:06:56        own network you can obviously keep on top of it you can maintain it and the chances of of you getting caught is a lot less the reverse of that or the opposite answer to that is if you're purchasing like for example if you're going to be using a service and it's like I don't know XY Z pbn.com right and you're buying pbn just remember that there's going to be hundreds of people buying the same links as you so these pbn's won't actually be private so just bear that in mind if you do have the resources if you


00:07:31        do have the time I always recommend building your own pbn network um cuz that's going to be a lot safer than going in purchasing your own or going and purchasing pbns what are the risks associated with pbns so the risks would obviously be like getting a Google penalty um again like what I've been saying before in this video ER if you are maintaining your pbn network if you're not purchasing pbn links then the chances of being penalized is a lot less because the thing is when it comes to purchasing somebody else's pbn links


00:08:08        they don't really care that much as as what you would because obviously it's it's your pbn network you obviously you're going to make certain that everything's kept up to date um there's less Footprints and stuff like that so just bear that in mind when it comes to um when it comes to doing any pbn work can pbn still be effective in today's so landscape like what I've just shown you guys this is built off of just pbn's like there's probably 60% of the the um backlink portfolio is is pbn's on that


00:08:39        website so yes it can be um efficient but obviously be careful if you are going to be doing that how can I safely use a pbn so what I would focus on is treat your pbn is is being like another money site um like a lot of people think pbn's um it's a TR crash website I'm just going to upload as much crap to it if you treat that pbn as an actual website like uploading quality content making certain that you're keeping it up to date making certain that you're doing everything that you would be doing on a money site


00:09:15        then in reality there's not really a reason for Google to actually penalize that website so just bear that in mind um how can I safely use a pbn so what I would do again um actually sorry I think I've just I answer that what should I look for when purchasing links from a pbn so criteria wise look at the Domain history make certain that it's not been free1 um you can obviously do that by looking at its um history on Wayback machine so for example if we go to Wayback machine and if we do a quick search so


00:09:54        this is what I would do if I'm looking at like a pbn network or if I'm looking to acquire a domain for a pbn look at Wayback machine and see if at any point there was a 301 redirect and look to see what it was actually getting redirected through to as well cuz that's really important if it was getting like 301 redirected to like a porn site um that could definitely cause some harm if you build um links from that site so you just want to make certain that it was just clean throughout throughout its


00:10:23        entire history and the best way that you can obviously do that is looking at way back machine how does owning your own pbn differ from using a service so like what I've said before if you own your pbn network yourself you're able to first of all you're going to care a lot more about it as opposed to like um buying it from a service a lot of service providers I've heard about um they just throw away pbn sites like there's no tomorrow so it might work today it might work tomorrow but in two three months time that pbn


00:10:57        service that you've been using might get penalized versus if you're hosting it yourself um you're obviously going to be making certain that there's less Footprints making certain that um it's kept up to date and stuff like that so yeah it's it's it's how I would probably look to build out a pbn network basically what are long-term consequences of using pbn's um so with pbn's if obviously if you don't keep up to date um you will lose rankings but that's like website even if you were to go and get a guest post um


00:11:32        if that website isn't kept up to date it's not going to provide much SE value in 6 or 12 months time so just bear that in mind are there alternatives to pbns for SEO improvements yes definitely um there are obviously you can do guest posts you can do Outreach you can do digital PR citations Niche edits you can do all variety of different things when it comes to link building um this isn't just the one strategy but the reason why I'm creating this video is because a lot of people say do pbn still work do they


00:12:04        not work um it's a it's it's an all it's an age old argument and as you can see here from this video from this data it does definitely work um are there any alternatives yep um how do how do search engines detect pbns so detecting pbns there's a variety of different ways that they can do it they can obviously look at um where the website's hosted um who the actual owner is um if it is hosted all on the same server IP they can definitely detect stuff like that so again um I'm not an expert when it comes


00:12:44        to like building out pbns there's probably better people than than me at doing it um but it's it's all about minimizing the footprints so if you can do that you can definitely do a relatively decent job in rankings and stuff like that as well so that's been my video on pbns and if they work I hope you I have answered any questions that you guys have if you do have any other questions on pbns um I know that I don't usually do black hat Style videos but I thought I'd make this video just to shed some light on if they still work or

00:01:09        talking about digital PR if you want to learn more head over to the master reminders.com grabb your ticket as while you can so when it comes to topical Authority the main thing that we want to be looking at is what's what's actually working for our competitors there's no point Reinventing in the wheel and the best way that we can actually do that we don't even need any tools I know I've got a hats open um here um in the background but we don't actually need to use any tools for this so let's say we


00:01:36        wanted to rank for um immigration lawyers in London for example or actually we'll do a different keywords we'll do divorce lawyers in London now what I would be looking at is the top one result or the top handful of results not just the top one uh 1 two three right anyone that's actually ranking for that and what we want to do is we want to use a couple different site operators now the the main thing when it comes to ranking for keywords like this which which are like service-based keywords like divorce


00:02:10        lawyers in London or dentists in London or solar panel companies in London you need to gain what's called topical Authority that's how Google trusts your website and it ranks you higher um so the best way that we can actually do that is by having what is called um blog articles pre-sale and also after sale as well so if I was to do for example site call on the website that we're looking at and then space divorce we are going to be showing a load of different divorce related blog articles that they've actually uploaded


00:02:49        now a few business owners I've spoke to in the past when it comes to SEO and stuff like they don't necessarily get this they don't understand why they need articles like the top six most common reasons why cut couples yet divorce like why should I have that on my website if I'm a divorce attorney or a divorce lawyer the reason for this is because you're demonstrating to Google that you are an expert in the industry um you're showing to Google like this is the main reasons why people get a divorce also by


00:03:18        the way if you're going through any of these reasons we are also able to help you with a divorce um attorney or hiring a divorce attorney that's the input or that that's the thought process when it comes to getting it what what's called these actual blogs so this is an example of how your website should look like and this doesn't matter if you're like an eCommerce store if you are a local business if you're an affiliate if you're SAS your website should look something like this you should have top-


00:03:46        of the funnel keywords and these are like awareness keywords so provide in informative and educational content to engage users who are in the initial research uh phase right so something like that would be like who gets the house in a divorce or legal separation or actually probably legal separation versus divorce um how long does a divorce take these are all um top of the funnel articles then if we take a look at middle of the funnel these could be like consideration so offer more detailed content that addresses specific pain


00:04:20        points compare Solutions and builds trust one place that you can get a lot of these top of funnel and also middle of funnel articles would be your your sales staff if you've got a um inbound team that already get a lot of calls a lot of emails um a lot of inquiries go and sit down with them for 20 30 minutes and say like hey what kind of questions do you get prior to somebody that wants a divorce or prior to somebody that wants solar panels or double glazing windows for example right and turn those


00:04:51        questions into blog articles because I'm I can guarantee if your sales staff is getting those questions asked there will be people searching those question questions on Google as well so that's a really good place to start also the reason why we have color coded in green yellow and or and or and red is because the top of funnel articles are typically ones that are easier to rank for as well the bottom of the funnel is obviously going to be like divorce attorney in Manchester or divorce attorney in New York those are


00:05:22        going to be harder to rank for keywords so another way that you can obviously do this is looking at who's ranking position number too um and I know that sounds like really boring but what I would be doing in this phase is creating a spread sheet with all different articles to do with divorce and obviously going through all of these so like types of divorce um explain starting divorce proceedings the divorce proceedings explained understanding your divorce final Order outof Court divorce legal advice how long does a divorce


00:05:55        take all of these are all related and it will help build out topical Authority when it comes to um divorces so you've got like uncontested divorce um uncontested versus contested divorces so what I'm going to do now is I'm just going to create a quick Google sheet and I'll show you exactly my stepbystep process so all I've done here is I have just created a brand new sheet um we'll call it um lawyer articles so all I'm going to do is I'm going to go back to this I'm going to hold out so I'm I'm using a a Chrome


00:06:31        extension called link Clump um I'm sure I've I've definitely told you guys about this before but link Clump extension so this basically allows you to C Mass copy pages so go and grab that and this will basically allow you to just copy all of these blog articles you can either like copy your competitor's blog articles or you can actually change the setting so we can do I believe it's this one uh where is the actual Chrome extension I am not seeing it um ah there it is there so we're going to click on options and


00:07:11        we're going to do um titles only because that's what we want right now so we're going to go back to the actual serup going to hold down Zed and we're going to click and drag all of these blog articles we're going to paste those in here now basically we do need to clean it up a little bit but as you can see here we've got all of the actual blogs um to do with um divorces so I'm just going to clean this up and as you can see we've got a load of different questions that we can actually include in our topical map so then we


00:07:49        would want to do this for all of like maybe the top four or five um key four or five competitors that are actually ranking for that keyword so again I'll just go back to Osborne law and I'm going to do the exact same process right now I'm not too worried about if there are any um duplicates because we're going to actually fix that in just a second so again I'm just going to copy all of these and paste this into my sheet these are all to do with divorce related blogs and as you can see we've got


00:08:20        around 20 yeah 20 different blog articles I'm also going to do this for position number three as well you could do this for like the top 10 spots if you really wanted to it's just going to take a little bit more time to actually go through it but again very similar process I'm just going to do site call on and I'm going to do divorce and we're just going to go through all of these different blogs um and we're going to copy these into our sheet so as we can see here we have got around 30 different blog articles now


00:08:53        what you would want to do as well is this is just for one service if you're a law firm or if you're a company you're going to have mult multiple different Services right so for example this um this Law Firm they also have got personal injury they've got property law so you would need to do the exact same process for all of your different services like all all it takes is literally just doing for example Osborne law um and then site call on and instead of doing divorce you would do personal injury for example if that's if that's


00:09:26        another service that you provide and then there's a load of different personal injury um personal injury blog articles like can you change citers during a personal injury claim arm injury claims how much compensation can I claim right so what I would do there is I would create another section here and this would be for like my second service so this would be like injury uh blogs for example or we could do like um immigration blogs let if you've got multiple Services some some companies don't I I


00:10:01        do understand that the next thing what we want to do is we want to make certain that this list is cleansed we want to make certain that there's no um that there are no mentions of our competitors that there's also no duplicates as well cuz in some cases if you're doing this for like four or five competitors there might be some overlap there so we're just going to click or we're going to copy this and we're going to use a very simple prompt in chat gbt so here is the actual prompt that I've used here are a list of my free


00:10:33        competitors and as we can see it's actually stopped generating let's click on regenerate um so I've just pasted in all of our blog articles from our sheet here and I've just said can you remove duplicates and also remove any brand mentions give me the list of page titles so I can create them as blogs and as we can see here there wasn't or there was actually two duplicates in that entire list so you've got divorce process explained starting divorce proceedings legal advice types of divorces understanding your divorce uh final


00:11:06        order out of out of court divorce how long does divorce take divorce between and divorce annulment um uncontested and contested divorces um and so on and so forth right I'm not going to go through every single one of them but that is how you want to be building out topical Authority for your site and I'm just going to replace this list here um with these blog articles and that is the blog titles that we actually need to create for our divorce blog now a few things to bear in mind when you are creating these blog articles you want to


00:11:44        give it like a source context like you want to mention like um if you're using AI for example or if you're using even a human writer you want to make certain that the human or the person that's actually writing or generating these blog articles they are mentioning your brand throughout the actual articles you are internally linking to pages that obviously make sense now a lot of websites would be internal linking to like their divorce page so if you're trying to rank for like divorce um lawyers in London for example these


00:12:16        should be um internal linking to your divorce Services page um or your divorce landing page so just make certain that you are continuously doing that it also makes sense to include internal links to the blog articles within the actual Silo so for example we're talking about types of divorces explained there might be like four or five different divorces you want to be building out blog articles for each different type of divorce like if if this was for let's say a solar panel company and we had types of solar panels


00:12:54        you want to obviously internal link to four or five different solar panels that you actually provide um and also install so that's step number the last step really um you also you also want to do this for all of your different Services typically speaking you want to as a complete minimum because I always get asked this try to at least build out four or five blog articles per service I see so many companies or so many websites they've just built out the actual service page but no actual blog articles underneath it and they they


00:13:25        just don't have any topical Authority this is what I recommend doing as an absolute bare minimum I know it takes a lot of time I did I did say at the start of the video it it does take a little bit of time but this is how you should be doing SEO um and I do understand that some businesses they don't want to be building out um top of funnel and middle of funnel but that is what is required when it comes to ranking um in Google if you guys have enjoyed this video please remember to leave a like and like what I

00:00:00        what's up guys julian goldie here and in today's video i will go over an on-page search engine optimization checklist for 2022. now if you're new to seo you might be wondering what on-page seo even is i mean you might have just thought there was only one kind of seo and what's this other thing for right well on-page seo is basically just a specific form of seo and it's a different type very different to link building or technical seo this is just about purely on page and what happens there so if you want to succeed


00:00:33        with seo you need to make sure you cover your bases when it comes to on page two or else all of your other tactics probably won't produce any results now luckily for you this video is going to show you exactly how you can do that plus much more we're going to cover what on-page seo actually is and why it's important plus we'll cover some of the specific seo tactics that will help you achieve amazing results and some of these tactics are really popular but some of them are actually kind of new and not many people know about them or


00:01:07        use them for example in section number four i'm going to go over an amazing on-page seo tactic that a lot of people really aren't using right now anyway make sure you stick around until the end or else you might miss that one on-page seo tactic it will take your campaigns to the next level so what is on-page seo well to begin with let's look at what it is and why it's important so generally when it comes to seo you typically have on-page seo and off-page seo off-page seo typically includes stuff like


00:01:36        backlinks and how you promote your website so that it will rank number one google on-page seo however focuses on all the things you do on your actual website to achieve good rankings so basically how you optimize the pages and content so that google knows what your website is about a lot of people think on-page seo is boring and it doesn't really get a lot of attention when compared to off-page stuff like link builder but this is a shame because it's actually super important and without it i wouldn't have been able to grow my


00:02:08        website cheaperbirds.com to the point where it generates tens of thousands of visitors every single month now i just want to say here that there are dozens and dozens of things you can potentially class as on-page seo now if you're dealing with a highly optimized website in a competitive niche that's ranking well it's generally a good idea to focus on every single aspect of on-page seo however if you're just building out a new website and you've not really focused on on-page seo just yet and you


00:02:40        don't really need to get into the weeds too much here that's because for most people they're really only a handful of on-page seo factors that deserve your attention if you optimize these factors it should be more than enough to rank well so the rest of this video will cover what those major things are and how you can optimize your website so it hits a mark when it comes to these crucial on-page seo issues by the way if you're enjoying this video please remember to like and subscribe if you like this video it will help us


00:03:11        reach more people plus if you become a subscriber you'll get access to our other seo checklists i mean there's a lot more up to seo than just on page and that means there's a lot of other checklists to cover too so subscribe and you'll discover what these other checklists are about and how to grow your website with them after all don't you need some more checklists in your life don't you need some more checklists in your life right now that that's over i don't think i ever want to say the word checklist


00:03:42        ever again so let's talk about user experience now when it comes to on-page seo one of the main things you want to focus on is providing an amazing user experience to people visiting your website now there are literally dozens of user experience metrics you could focus on but when it comes to seo there's really only two you want to pay attention to by the way i also just want to say i'm going to cover a few tools in this section if you want to check these tools out for yourself you can find links to them in the


00:04:12        description of this video okay so the first user experience factor you want to focus on is page loading time this is really important because google is starting to put a lot of focus into promoting websites that load quickly in fact they've actually announced publicly that they use this as a ranking factor after all google wants to provide people with a good user experience and if your website loads slowly people will get frustrated if these people find your website for google they might transfer some of the frustration


00:04:42        to google and then decide to use another search engine of course good old google doesn't want this to happen so that's why they're going to punish you if you have a slow website that makes them look bad so with all that said how do you know if your website meets google's requirements when it comes to loading times i mean how fast are we talking here do you need to get a stopwatch out well google has a free tool called page speed insights and if you type your url into this tool you'll get a score based


00:05:11        on the performance of your website as well as some detailed feedback on loading times for example here's what shows up when i put my desktop website through this tool as you can see it scores pretty well here that said if i scroll down a little bit i can see some suggestions on how i can make things even better my website is already performing well when it comes to this aspect of on-page seo thank god but if i really wanted to push my on-page optimization to the next level i would definitely consider acting on these


00:05:41        things now if you put your website through this tool and you get a bad score back there's a few things you can do to make things even better if the scores are really bad you might just want to consider redesigning your website and using something like wordpress as your content management system most popular wordpress themes are pretty well optimized and by using wordpress alongside a popular theme it's not that hard to quickly boost your page speed above scores of 90. of course if you're already using


00:06:09        wordpress and your score is kind of just average you might want to consider using a different theme if you guys know of any awesome fast loading themes let me know in the comments i'd love to check them out now if you really love the design of your website you might just want to hire a developer to help you optimize your site so that it performs better if you tell them to act on the suggestions provided by the pagespeed insights tool they should be able to deliver good improvements on loading times anyway the


00:06:35        other thing you want to focus on when it comes to user experience is whether your website works well on a mobile device again this is another thing that google really cares about and it's something that actively focusing on when it comes to deciding on rankings which makes sense right i mean no matter what niche you're in there's a strong chance lots of your visitors are going to be using a mobile device to find and access your site now if your site ignores these people why should google rank your site


00:07:04        google has another tool that checks if your site is mobile friendly and it's got a clever and exciting sounding name for it ready it's called the mobile friendly test okay so this tool doesn't have the most exciting name in the world but it's still super useful and easy to use you basically just put your url in the tool and it will then tell you if your website is mobile friendly if your site scores poorly here you might want to just go through the steps we mentioned earlier so you may want to install wordpress and then use a highly


00:07:32        rated mobile friendly theme or you might just want to reach out to the developer and work with them so that your site can become more mobile friendly okay so those are the two key things you need to focus on when it comes to on-page seo as mentioned there are links to these tools in the description if you have any suggestions on tools that might help out with some of the things we've covered here let me know in the comments and now let's move on to some of the other things you might want to pay attention to as well the


00:07:57        third thing to pay attention to is security and this is the overall security of your website now this might sound like a big and scary topic but there's actually one key thing you want to focus on and that's the use of ssl certificates if you didn't know an ssl certificate makes it so that your website provides people with a secure https connection even if you don't realize it you probably have a ton of experience with this already i mean if you're browsing a website you'll often see a padlock right next to where


00:08:26        the url is in your browser this padlock means that the website you're using is making use of a https connection and this end means that the traffic is encrypted all of which makes it difficult for hackers to steal data okay great you need to protect your users by setting up an ssl certificate but how do you even do that well in most cases your hosting company should be able to provide you with an ssl certificate sometimes you'll have to pay for that but some offer it for free as well if you're on a budget you might want to


00:08:59        look at hosting companies that do this before you fully build out your site anyway if you're paying for an ssl certificate keep in mind that they generally expire after 12 months or so because of this you need to make sure you renew them as well if you forget about this you might end up hurting your rankings if google realizes that your website no longer has ssl now the next thing we're going to focus on here is optimizing your content a lot of the time this tends to be the main thing people focus on when it comes to on-page


00:09:26        seo but if you ignore all the other stuff we've covered already you won't get very far even if you have awesome content that's super optimized so with that said when optimizing your content what do you need to be focusing on well you basically just want to make sure your content is optimized around the topic and keyword you're trying to target so if you're creating a piece of content that targets a certain keyword you'll want to make sure you include your main keyword as well as related keywords throughout the main body of


00:09:53        your content you'll also want to make sure that you include the main keyword and related keywords in the headers you have in your content as well now there are a few key points i just want to mention here first if you're writing a thorough piece of content on a given topic you might just end up naturally doing this i mean it'd be hard to create a thorough detailed article based on a specific keyword without mentioning the main keyword and related keywords throughout your post of course if this doesn't happen naturally you might want


00:10:22        to intervene and adjust your text a little so that your keywords appear in your article however if you're just going to do this you want to be careful of going over the top you don't want to over optimize here because if you go over the top and you optimize too much google will think you might be doing something called keyword stuffing and that's basically when you overuse a given keyword to improve your odds of ranking for that at one point this used to work really well but now it's just going to get you in trouble with google


00:10:49        and if you're guilty of doing this you might lose your rankings or never rank at all because google just doesn't like it ps if you want a clear guide on what keyword stuffing actually is here's a page from google's guidelines that covers the topic quite nicely okay so with all that said how do you make sure you optimize your content so that includes your main keyword and related keywords without annoying google as mentioned if you're genuinely trying to write a good thorough article on a given topic you might end up including your


00:11:18        keyword and related keywords pretty much by default however if you want some direct tips you might just want to make sure you include your target keyword once in the intro a few times throughout the body of your text at least once in the h2 tagger and at least once in your conclusion as well again as i said you should also include related keywords throughout your post too however you don't need to really focus on including these the same way you would for a main target keyword instead you kind of just


00:11:47        want to naturally pepper them throughout your content and if you want to find related keywords you can just look at some of the suggested keywords associated with your main keyword on google for example suppose i own a website about sheds and i want to write a blog where the main keyword is how to build a shed if i look at the suggested keywords i can see a list of other keywords based on this if i want to find related keywords i could also just focus on finding some of the auto suggestions that appear when i type my main keyword


00:12:18        into the search bar of google for example here's some of the auto suggestions that came up based on my how to build a shared keyword as you can see these are all pretty good suggestions if i'm writing a detailed long form post on this topic it will be too hard to include these keywords naturally throughout my content now i just want to say that there's the option of taking a more clinical approach here that's because i could think about using tools to optimize my content so that it does well when it comes to on-page seo and


00:12:48        one such tool you might want to consider is phrase dot io i've mentioned phrase in a few videos of mine previously but if i tell phrase the keyword i'm targeting it'll provide me with a quota based on how many times i should include my core keyword and it will also provide me with related keywords and these will have quotas too for example here are some suggestions and quotas based on my how to build a shared keyword phrase will also provide me with a list of suggestions i should cover when writing


00:13:16        a post on a specific topic if i meet all of these requirements when producing my content there's a good chance i'm going to outperform my competition when it comes to having optimized keywords actually rank this is really critical when you consider how important optimized content is in relation to on-page seo and just seo in general if you want to learn more about phrase and how it can help you check out this video of mine how i ranked number one with phrase.io fast where i cover this tool in a bit more detail something i also


00:13:46        want to just touch on here is image optimization i think this is an important thing to mention because some on-page seo guides tend to forget this there are basically two things you want to focus on when it comes to image optimization firstly you want to make sure you're using the right alt tags and captions for your images in case you didn't know all tags are basically the bit of text you see when you hover a cursor over an image if you use relevant all tags and captions it'll be easier for google to


00:14:17        figure out what a given image is about and this will then help them figure out what your page is generally about this is really important because it will make it easier for you to rank for relevant terms in your niche by the way if you're using wordpress it's actually pretty easy to do this as you can just adjust all tags and captions whenever you insert an image in a post anyway another thing you want to focus on here when it comes to image optimization is actually optimizing the sizes of your images


00:14:47        earlier we touched upon the importance of page speed loading times in a lot of cases your web page might load slowly because your images are too big so you can easily compress these with plugins on wordpress like smush and plugins like these can compress your images without massively hurting the quality so they load faster if you want to check it out you can find a link to this in the description of this video okay guys so that's the end of this video hopefully now you have a decent sense of how


00:15:15        on-page seo works and how you should approach things if you have any questions please let me know in the comment section i'll be happy to answer them anyhow thanks for watching and remember to like and subscribe if you like our videos it will help us reach more people and if you subscribe you'll get to hear me talk about my other checklists such as my checklist on how to put your life back together after google wipes your website out with an update [Music] how dare you you


----------------------------------


00:00:00        so for this onpage SEO tutorial I'm going to be looking at this page on got seo.com and it's targeting does Google penalize AI content so that is the keyword phrase that it's going after and if we look at the keyword volume it's about 210 searches per month it's not super competitive uh but if we do I'll show you some stuff here in a second but there are some pretty heavy Authority sites that are ranking okay so we do need to make sure we have a good piece of content so this is going to be the one that we're going to be focusing on


00:00:29        and you can see I've got some Benchmark ranking rankings here so you can see in uh what actually moved back to agency analytics recently but this is a February 25th it was at about 49 it's gone as high as about 15 so it's never reached the first page it's been kind of sitting uh here you know in the third or fourth page typically and if we look in semrush you'll see that it's not actually performing super well it kind of peaked out here in January and just been pretty flat overall okay so it's not it's not performing the way it needs


00:01:00        to and as we go through this checklist you're going to see there's a lot of reasons why it's probably not performing okay so looking at the content there's a few things we want to do we're going to go through this checklist and before we get into the the you know the Deep onpage SEO stuff we want to make sure that we do our preliminary checks okay so some preliminary checks we're going to copy this URL we're going to go into Google and just paste that raw URL into Google and make sure that it's indexed


00:01:26        if you're not sure you know if you don't trust the personalization we'll just go Incognito we'll paste it again and once again it's indexed in Google okay so all of nothing else will matter here uh if if this is not indexed okay so all the stuff I'm about to show you will not will be totally irrelevant if your if your url is not indexed all right so we're going to go back in here we're going to mark this as pass all right next one is the page older than 60 days yes we know it's older than 60 days it


00:01:53        was published I believe in October 2023 okay so we got that one we're good to go all right now is the page built to satisfy the intent of the keyword okay so just based on you know Common Sense You could argue that it it is but because it's not performing well we're actually going to want to do a secondary check on this all right because typically when we see something that isn't performing super well we really want to see what's going down so go over here and we want to see ultimately what is ranking all right what is ranking


00:02:28        here and there's a possibility that maybe my page was uh maybe the angle was a little too unique for this keyword okay so we need to look at these results and kind of get a better idea of kind of what we're up against here and it looks like yeah there's a possibility that it could have been off maybe the sentiment was a little off um so there's there's certainly a possibility there okay so I'm actually just going to mark this one as a fail all right next one is is the page high quality original helpful and


00:02:59        up to-date now you can manually look at a page and know that I mean obviously I'm biased but I think this page is certainly helpful I think it's helpful it's Unique it's original but it's not super deep right it doesn't go really that deep it's pretty short um and it's more of just a case study it's not so much like a deep uh kind of opinionated asset it's just providing some data and letting people come up with their own conclusions um and that's not necessarily a bad thing but I think there's room for improvement so we're


00:03:27        going to go ahead and Mark that as a fail all right now go about word count now just to clarify here word count is not a ranking Factor just simply having a lot of words on your page is not a ranking Factor uh but word count is important because it gives you the ability to add more relevance to the page so without a lot of words you can't add a whole lot of relevance in depth it's just the only way for that to occur is you need words to make that happen so uh what I do is actually I'll run it through rankability the content


00:03:57        Optimizer and this is the this is the actual content that I imported and you'll see this optimal range the one thing about rankability that's a little bit different than the other tools is that this is not an average this is a median so we're taking the median word count which means we're eliminating the outliers and we're only showing the word count uh that's most appropriate so I would't name any other tools but some other tools they really inflate the word count a lot because they're typically


00:04:23        taking it average so we're eliminating the outliers and getting a p you know really a good word count Target that's not you know unrealistic okay so based on this this is a fail right I'm at at 482 I should be about let's say a little over a th000 words so we're going to go ahead and Mark that as a fail and then uh you know is it free of excessive uh I got a spelling here free of excessive grammar and spelling issues uh once again if you get the grammarly Chrome extension uh this operates well with rankability and you'll see you can


00:04:55        see any issues here that might be popping up uh nothing too severe though right nothing nothing super intense here that I would be concerned about so actually just give this a pass that's not what I'm worried about uh and then does the page load fast and have a good user experience so we'll copy this and then we'll just run this through uh Google page speed insights so we can also run this through a broken link Checker here on atrs and this looks like there are no broken links here so we can go ahead and Mark


00:05:20        that as a pass and this is actually down here mark this one and then we'll see the overall speed here on this and it looks like on mobile uh we're not doing too hot yeah it's about a 60 so that's not good we want to get this you know bare minimum get it to at least a 70 80 in most cases on desktop it's sitting about 84 so it's probably fine there but we need to see why it's not doing very well on mobile so we're actually going to mark that as a fail so these preliminary checks are really important


00:05:50        because you don't want to go through this onpage SEO process without making sure you've gotten this all squared away so really at this point for me uh you know I just need to I need to clean these up get this squared away get these all to solid passes and once I've done that then it makes sense to go through and do the keyword placement okay so I'm going to be walking through kind of the revision of this this asset and then you know going through the the on page SEO once it's where it needs to be but to be


00:06:17        able to do that I need to know what how to actually structure this content the right way because the biggest challenge right now is if you go to this point number 17 is the content optimized for NLP if if you look at my content it's not doing very well okay so the rank ability score is a 10 we should be aiming for about a 37 the reason why this is so low is be for a few few reasons number one work count is low so therefore I can't really inject a lot of these topics in here but I also just haven't hit on a lot of the main topics


00:06:48        um in fact I haven't even mentioned like artificial intelligence I haven't talked about AI tools like I'm missing tons and tons of topics so what I'm going to do is I'm going to rebuild this content uh from scratch now I'm going to retain some of this data here some of this good stuff that makes the content very linkable but I'm going to really rebuild this content so it's optimized better okay and i' I've done this countless times with various pages and so I'll give you just a couple examples this


00:07:16        blog post it was a completely AI content all right for a long time so if you look back here this is like when I first published it September 20122 and it was all pure Ai and it was a pure AI test and we just let it ride for a really long time time so then what we did is we went back to it to it rebuilt it from scratch uh and we rebuilt it with NLP in mind okay so we rebuilt it with NLP in mine um and and exactly I'm going to be showing here in a second and we took it from like a rankability score of like I don't know


00:07:45        it like 20 and then now it's like an insane rankability score but the point is that you can see the difference here in performance right like look how many keywords it's gained um and now it's starting to rank for the things we wanted to rank for and that's because we've built it with NLP in mind that is the key so most pages that are not performing well typically will have a kind of a correlation there which is usually just not typically the most relevant result for that query and that's what we're trying to be we're


00:08:13        trying to be the most relevant result uh and the deepest result as well so based on that and go in rankability and there's a few things we can do we can go into the content brief uh we'll go into the content brief here and I can generate a brief using the AI brief like this and get it kind of set up to where it needs to go and I can go into the outline and autogenerate an outline as well okay so there's clearly some things in this in this that I missed in the actual content so I can actually go over


00:08:39        here into the optimizer and I can just add some of these you know components of this outline in here okay so now that my outline is set now it's time to actually just start going through and taking these topics and putting them in the most important spots and then just actually rewrite this content and what you're going to see is I'm actually going to walk through writing this whole thing in front of you you're going to see how fast I go through this and what you want to do is you really don't want


00:09:05        to be thinking about you know doing on page SEO in a way where you just like come and do an asset and inject we're thinking about in a way that we're filling in gaps we're building more relevance we're increasing the depth of the content that's what the objective is here and so that's what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to increasing the depth of this content then I'm going to republish it okay so I've gone through and officially upgraded this page so I can pass these preliminary checks and be


00:09:28        able to actually do the rest of this content now I've pretty much gone through and hit a lot of these checkpoints I'm just going to walk you through this real quickly so is the page built to satisfy the intent of the keyword we're going to go back to it here's the new asset and here's the old asset okay so this original asset was fine but it was just a little a little thin uh didn't fully answer this question in depth with the new asset we did we answered it in much more depth uh hit on a lot more points and it's


00:09:54        officially you know within that range that we're going for which is you know we're we're in the optimal rankability score and we're in the ideal word count range uh which once again is not a is not a ranking Factor but it's ALS it's a it's a way for us to build more relevance it gives us that flexibility to build relevance on the page okay so we're going to go in here we're going to change this to a pass now uh is the page high quality original helpful and up to dat I would argue yes uh it is up to


00:10:23        date it is original uh it is helpful so it hits on all those points as well all right so this is really important we want to be passing the before we think about doing on page SEO is the workout sufficient we know this that passes the the test and then does the page load fast and have a good user experience we already tested this uh this is not one I actually went through and fixed but somewhat diminishing returns after a certain point so uh not a big concern of mine but it is something if I see that


00:10:48        this isn't moving the way that I would like then I will go back and reoptimize this page for uh loading speed okay now next you want to do is now we officially passed checks want to start to go through these different phases so keyword placement all right so we basically want to have that keyword placed in the most important spots and what you want to do is before you even think about optimizing for NLP you always want to make sure that the keywords are placed in the core locations that really matter okay so you


00:11:16        just go to the detailed Chrome extension and you're going to look up here and there's a few spots you want to hit we want it to be in the title we want it to be typically somewhere in the meta description but this really isn't as important we definitely want it to be in the URL okay it doesn't matter whether you use folders or however you set up your url structure what you want though is that that that that phrase should appear in the URL in one shape or form okay that's really really critical then


00:11:43        the headings we wanted to show up in the H1 and ideally you can also put a variation in the H2 so you can see that I've I've included kind of the concept in here but I didn't do the exact keyword phrase this is a slight variation uh and then ideally we'd want to have that main keyword somewhere in here but in the case of what I'm doing here it's a little different strategy uh is I'm trying to capture a featured snippet so I'm pushing this way up above the fold giving an answer to this question right away and you know from


00:12:13        that perspective I'm hoping that I can capture that feature snippet now if this does not perform the way that I like then I will move uh move that into the first sentence okay so a lot of these these are all going to be good passes metad description I'm going to say fail because it's not in there we'll do pass here pass here uh in the first 100 words I'm actually going to do a fail on this so I remember that I need to go back and clean that up and then a pass okay this is really important because you don't


00:12:40        need to get passing marks in every single thing this is a way for us to look at like you know where we're doing really well and then also looking at kind of where our deficits are and we're going to see how far we can go uh you know given some of the deficits that we have if you can if you can rank number one with failing marks then you're good to go it doesn't you don't need to do anything else so that's what I'm doing is I'm doing what I think is best for this keyword but if I find that it needs to be


00:13:06        optimized more I have that flexibility to do that okay now links we're going to go down here uh are you linking to other relevant Pages under website via internal linking and then some of these other um other ones here so let's go down here uh you'll see that I'm I'm linking out to uh external websites this one links out to Amazon very very high quality trusted entity that's by Design design you should link out to very trusted sources like your external links should be highly highly trusted okay I


00:13:35        tend to link out a lot to Google related things okay so linking out to Google uh linking out to things that are really relevant in my industry got some internal links going in here as well so once again all by Design we've got internal links and then the last piece of this is that do the links look like links and the short answer is yes they do look like links right this is what we want you want to be clear within the body of your content that the link really stands out you don't want it to blend with the content you want to have


00:14:03        contrast okay so these are all going to be passes uh and once again this just a quick way to make sure that you're you're really doing uh you're upholding the standards of quality in your content okay next one is on the image side so are the images original in high quality are they optimized for loading speed and are they using uh descriptive file names and ALT tags okay so once again the most important part of this like the alt tags and the file names they're not really that important really what matters is


00:14:32        the quality of your images and the originality of your images so looking at this this is an original image that I created just used canva to create it nothing special uh but it's it's Unique to my brand it's Unique to my website no one else has it right so if you go and do a reverse image search hopefully no one has it maybe some people have taken it but you can see like this is unique to to my to my website okay so there's some that have like kind of a similar format but this type of image is exactly


00:15:02        it comes from my website no one else's so it's original okay that's what you want you don't want to just think about how original your like the copywriting is you also want to think about how original your images and your visuals and your videos and all that good stuff so you can see like once again this image is one that I created personally uh nothing special but it illustrates the point that I'm trying to make uh once again a video that's specific to my brand I this is an entity of my channel


00:15:26        so Nathan gotch is an entity associated with got SEO so Google can you know align those things to you know together okay so got a unique video Unique Images unique content my goal is always to have original all the way through the board like across the board I want everything to be original the copy the images the videos uh the angle everything like that's what I'm aiming for okay when I do this so once again we're going to go ahead and put passes across the board on this this is all good and then eat okay


00:15:56        I won't go through all of these but and once again EA is not necessarily A ranking factor it's more of an indirect effect which it should uh you know as a user lands on your site you want them to trust the trust the page that they're landing on so what I do is I I give some kind of right away I give some marks that should hopefully uh generate some levels of trust when someone lands on my page number one is you know it's I actually know who the author is so if you click through on the author we can


00:16:22        go and see I have a dedicated author page specifically for you know for me and I have all my experience experience and stats and credibility and other things that I've written so you know there's just a lot of a lot of proof at least that's on a surface level that someone could at least trust what they're reading okay that's what we're trying to do um and and this should be like at a glance you should see this uh publish date which is recent and then uh I'd like to add this little fact check thing uh just for fun okay doesn't do


00:16:52        anything but it's just for fun it's just to create more trust in your content and the more that people trust your content the better user engagement you're going to get on your page the better user engagement you get on your page the better that page will perform in search cuz Google as you know tracks everything in Google Chrome and across all Google products so and it's actually been in their Core case that they actually are measuring uh you know Scrolls and clicks and engagement on page to determine uh


00:17:18        if that page is a good fit for the keyword that you're ranking for okay so it starts with Organic CTR like people actually clicking through on your result but once they get to your page are they is is their dwell time are they clicking around are they going to a second page like are they uh submitting a lead form right are they going here and actually you know applying for your training or your whatever program or whatever it is like are they converting okay this all matters um and then so I've got this all


00:17:45        squared away this is all very specific to my website in particular but if you go and look we go back to the page um and you'll see at the bottom I've got one more final piece here which is just have a little author box okay really simple little short explanation of who I am and then linking out to my you know my social profiles uh just to prove that I'm a legitimate person okay so there's a footprint that I'm a real person here okay uh and someone that you know at least on the surface appears to have


00:18:14        some credibility okay that's what we're trying to do so no matter who the author is you're trying to prove your credibility very fast and this is not because it's going to be a ranking Factor your rankings are not going to climb because you did this but it's more because it's going to help the user trust your page and when users Trust your page and users like your content and users engage with your content that is a ranking Factor okay that's what matters so get all that squared away we're good here on that and the final is


00:18:40        on goal completions so every page should have some sort of objective now for me you know mine typically my objectives in my informational content there's a few number one I want people to go and like apply for my training maybe go and work with my agency maybe sign up for my you know my software buy my book whatever it maybe sometimes I'll directly pitch those in the content sometimes I won't other times I'm just getting them to go to a second page on my website right so like maybe I want them to go to you know


00:19:08        SEO for dentist and read this and you know get get involved here and this leads to a conversion page that's specific for my agency okay so what we want here is it's not necessarily always going to be like a direct conversion like they they become a lead or they buy something of yours but sometimes it's as simple as them just visiting a second page on your site that is technically a goal completion for your content and Google once again it's not like they're they're tracking specific types of goal completions on


00:19:37        your site but they're tracking the way that users engage on your content the way the users engage on your site and if they're just landing on your stuff and clicking off within seconds not a good sign okay not a good sign at all so we want to do whatever we can to keep them on our websites and in fact you should learn from websites like YouTube and Tik Tok and all these super addictive platforms they don't want you to leave the site they want to retain you for as long as possible so that's what you should be


00:20:03        trying to do on your own website and that's also what Google's going to be measuring as well okay so that's it guys nothing super complicated uh but this always comes down to really these preliminary checks this is what matters right too many people will look at a page and like all right we need to do on page SEO let's just Dive Right into this and start injecting a bunch of key words in our content without any thought don't do that just don't do that what you want to do is focus on these preliminary


00:20:29        checks this is where all the this is like the 80% of the impact that you will get is from these preliminary checks you get these right and then the rest will just fall into place the rest this is like really micro stuff that will certainly help so I'd say it as far as importance this section is the most important and then secondary is this section here so if you get these two sections right that's honestly that's probably like 95% of the onpage SEO work okay and then the rest of this is just kind of minor stuff


00:20:58        that may maybe direct more than likely is indirectly affects your performance okay so that's it simple as that um and if you guys uh are interested in the uh rankability tool I'll have a link below this video uh and thanks for watching


--------------------------------------


00:00:00        My name is Chris Palmer and in today's onpage SEO  that will be perfect for you as a beginner let's get into the six elements of doing onpage SEO that  will actually make sure that you're going to get significant ranking increases with just onpage so  the very first thing that you have to be focused on when doing your onpage SEO is you need to  understand intent the intent of the keyword is going to determine what type of content you  need to write first and foremost and what type of content that you're going to optimize now I'm  going to give you examples bear with me here first


00:00:41        and foremost is the intent if you're writing  for let's say plumber um Houston the intent here is that Google is rewarding okay Google  is rewarding homepages and service Pages the has a commercial intent right so you can't write  a blog article and rank for plumber Houston so whatever service or whatever type of keyword  you're thinking about optimizing for or writing an article for it's going to be a great idea to  go over to Google look at the current results and see what type of page is Google rewarding  because if you write the wrong page you could


00:01:29        do all the the onpage SEO in the world it's  never going to rank let's move on to tip number two tip number two is what type of page is Google  rewarding you know the intent of the keyword and what type of page is Google rewarding they go  hand inand so that's probably why I led right into number two when I was speaking about number one  because we need to look at Google and understand okay what's the intent and what is Google  rewarding let me give you another example okay another example would be um how to fix a leak now  this this applies to affiliate this applies to


00:02:11        e-commerce this applies to local I'm just showing  these examples because I was just talking to a plumber okay so if I scroll down take a look at  this if you're trying to have this keyword on your service page or on a homepage it's not going  to work this has informational intent right the intent is informational what is Google rewarding  Google is rewarding an an inner page that's going to give tips about fixing a leaky pipe and it's  looking like four ways so they want more than one way they want to give you some tips a video  would also do very well so a page that's going to


00:02:51        have four or five tips that includes a video will  potentially do very well right always look at the keyword look at the intent this plays massively  into the part of your onpage optimization don't optimize around the wrong intent is what I'm  getting at here let's move on to the next tip the next tip is well what is the average word  count let's have another example let's use an affiliate site as an example this time average  word count is massively important so how you can go about doing this is regardless of whatever  the keyword is so let's do it affiliate um


00:03:30        uh how to get a loan for my home fast let's just  we're just going to use that okay if I'm taking a look at these all right we know that the intent  right we talked about the intent we know what Google's rewarding what we're going to do is  we need to come up with an average word count now this is very important every keyword that you  want to ring for you need to understand what what word count Google is rewarding okay you have it's  mandatory you can get away with writing more and you can get away with writing less but if you're  going to do SEO the O stands for optimization that


00:04:13        means we want to be optimal we're optimizing for  search we want to optimize our content for the best probability of being able to rank right so  it's I I don't want to guess there's no guessing what's Google rewarding what's the average that's  what you write period end the statement okay let me share this with you so what I use is SEO Quake  when I'm when I'm going to give my word counts to my writer or I'm going to write it myself I  always go and see what's the top three or four performers what's the average word count it's  very simple so I go to the top guy or gal or


00:04:52        company 3,000 words okay the next person has  let me guess somewhere around 3,000 oh 4500 perfect the next guy 2,000 okay so what's the  average well you pull out your calculator you do 4,000 plus 3,000 plus 2,000 equals divide  that by the three sites we need about 3,000 words job done what's the average word count  look at the top three to five performers come up with an average that's how many words you  need to write let's move on to the next tip the next step is going to be the average heading  count all right let's use a different example for


00:05:36        a different Niche so this way you know that  no matter what whether you're doing local whether you're doing affiliate whether you're  doing e-commerce whether you're writing info content or you have a service or a product  SEO is almost the same you have to understand what is Google rewarding and optimize to the  serp that's it okay and of course have good content have pretty pictures right the other  pieces play but I'm I'm giving you the most impactful elements of onpage SEO right here  giving it to you I I want you to do better


00:06:12        so let's take a look at this average heading  count all right 99.99999% of the time there's only going to be one each1 what we're really  trying to determine is what's the average word count we know there's only one age1 but how many  headings do we need total let's pick a new keyword all right we come into here let's pick  a new keyword let's say it's e-commerce um um best lipsticks okay best  lipsticks come in here all right this this could be affiliate too all  right this tool is called SEO Pro extension

00:13:35        of 38 73% of the headers need to be optimized  if you want to compete in this Ser you need to optimize about 70% of your headings so if you  only had 10 on the page you need to optimize seven of them this is how you do the calculation  right you can use this tool you probably know better way than me I use these online tools  all the time like The Meta like this tool the I use SEO Quake I use SEO Pro extension and  I use this calculator all the time when I'm doing analyzation for my forio clients like literally I  do it all the time the next thing all right let's

---------------------------------


00:00:00        Search engines like Google are growing more sophisticated every day, and you may be wondering, are on-page SEO techniques still relevant? The answer is yes, but not all. Some techniques still work, and they help search engines understand your content quicker. So if you want your pages to rank higher, let's discover the SEO techniques that still work. Let's go. Hey, it's Jack from Rank Math, the One Tool, that provides easy to use SEO and AI tools, and this channel provides you with tips, tricks, and tutorials


00:00:31        to help you grow your search traffic. So if you're new to us, subscribe. Now, there are on-page and off-page SEO. On-page is all about optimizing the page for search intent, and it helps search engines understand the content better. While off-page is meant to help the popularity of that page. If you have Rank Math installed on your WordPress site, you don't have to worry about on-page optimization because most of it has been taken care of automatically and behind the scenes. And for things you need to optimize, we have many SEO checks that will guide you


00:01:01        towards the right direction. If you want to learn about each of the SEO checks in detail, you can check out this video right here. The link is in the description. But this video highlights the important techniques that are not covered in the other video. So let's check out the first. Optimizing for internal links is one of the most important on-page SEO techniques you should employ. The way search engines assess the quality of a site is if you're writing one piece of article, are there any other supporting pieces of content on the same


00:01:31        site that can help support and add depth to that one piece of article. It is the same way search engine robots crawl your sites. They crawl from one page and they visit the pages linked to that page and crawl them, and it goes on and on. The more depth you provide to a topic, the higher the quality of your entire site in the eyes of the search engine. In one of our SEO checks, we check if you have added at least one internal link in your article. Take note that this SEO check is synced with our Content AI analysis.


00:02:00        For example, this is our Content AI research tool, and we are writing a piece of article about the benefits of exercising. Hit research, and Content AI will scrape and analyze all the articles that are ranking for this keyword and will provide you with smart suggestions to optimize your page. Over here, it is suggesting that we should have eight internal links. Now, if Content AI does not recommend any internal links here, which is rarely the case, but if that happens, then this SEO check here will be hidden.


00:02:30        Another thing I want to talk about is the optimization of the anchor text of the internal links. Do not overuse the same anchor text for several articles. If you're not familiar with anchor text, it is just the text that describes what people can expect when they click on the link. For example, this article about on-page SEO has a link to a page about SEO tips and uses the anchor text as SEO. Then in the next article about technical SEO, you are adding a link to a page about SEO mistakes. Using the same anchor text, SEO.


00:03:02        Then when you write another article about SEO ranking factors, you link to another page about SEO checklist with the same anchor text, SEO. If you are the search engine and you visited this site, you'll be confused as well, right? It is using SEO as an anchor text, and it describes these three pages. There could be more. So as a search engine, how do I give weight and importance when talking about SEO? So if you do this, you are losing the opportunity to help search engines understand what keywords are important to what pages.


00:03:34        So it will be prudent to have a clear description, hopefully a rankable keyword, when describing the link to a page. So when talking about SEO mistakes, you will use that anchor text on all other pages and it links to the SEO Mistakes page. Search engines will know this page is important when we are talking about SEO mistakes. And when we talk about SEO tips, then this page is important. Hope you find the SEO technique useful, and how about a thumbs up for the video. Anyway, if you want to understand more about how each page of your website


00:04:04        helps each other on your overall SEO, you should check out this video that talks about silo structure, as well as this video that talks about content hubs. We have left links to these videos in the description. Writing a piece of an article for your website is very similar to the contents of a book, or if you have ever written a project report in high school, college, or university, the structure of the content is very similar. Think of your content as follows. The title of your article is like the tree trunk.


00:04:31        It is the main part that holds everything together and sets the foundation for the rest of the content. The H1 heading tag represents the tree trunk. It is important to use only one H1 tag per page to clearly define what the page is about. This helps both the page visitors and search engines understand the main focus of your content. For example, the main topic could be the benefits of exercising. Then the H2 tags are like the main branches of the tree. These tags represent primary sections that grow out of the main topic.


00:05:03        For example, since the main topic is about the benefits of exercising, you could have H2 tags with physical health benefits, mental health benefits, and how to start exercising. These main sections break down your content into more specific areas, making it easier to navigate and understand. They not only help organize your article and provide a clear structure, but they make it easier for your page visitors to scan your page. And then the H3 heading tags are like the smaller branches. These subsections provide more detailed information under each main section.


00:05:36        In this example, H3 tags under the physical health benefits can be improve heart health, boost immunity, enhance muscle strength, and others. And then the hierarchy goes on. The H4, H5, and H6 heading tags acts as the leaves and tweaks of your content tree. If you can break down further on the benefits of improving heart health, you would use H4. Breaking it down further, you would use H5, and then up to the H6 heading tag. If you are writing a blog post on a WordPress editor, by default, the title of the page will be embedded with the H1 heading tag.


00:06:09        And throughout the page, there should not be another H1 heading tag. So following the previous example, the title of the H1 heading tag will be benefits of exercising. You could include a number in front of the title when you decide on the exact number of benefits. Then you can have a short introduction here and then break it up with H2 heading tag. You will add a new text blog, type out the text such as physical health benefits, mental health benefits, and how to start exercising, and make each of the text here a H2 heading.


00:06:39        We click on this, and then this, transform it to a heading, and by default, this is a H2 heading. The same goes for this, and here we go. Now we have three H2 headings. And then you could describe each of the H2 headings. And then if you want to break down a H2 heading further, like for physical health benefits, we could have improve heart health, boost immunity, and enhances muscle strength. We'll make this into a H3 heading. The same goes for this as well as this. Normally, when you write an article, you would try to create the structure of the


00:07:17        content before focusing on the details. If you want to see the overall structure and hierarchy of your page, you can leverage on the WordPress outline tool by clicking on this. Click on the outline, and now you will see the hierarchy of the page. Never skip the hierarchy. You shouldn't have a H4 heading tag without a H3. For example, you shouldn't add a H4 heading tag within the H2 if there is no presence of a H3. Like this. You see, WordPress also prompts you that this is an incorrect heading level.


00:07:47        So following the heading hierarchy is a good SEO practice because that's how search engines will interpret your page. Now, if you have troubles coming up with a content structure of your own, or if you want to quickly have an SEO-optimized content structure, You can always leverage on our AI to do that for you. You can either hit double slashes, search for blog, and you will see the blog post outline tool here. Or you can click on the content AI module right at the top, click on the third icon, and the tool is right here.


00:08:16        Add your topic, benefits of exercising. This is a required field. Mark with this asterisk. The rest are not. Then you want to include any main points and ideas you have. If not, leave it empty. Decide on the audience. Add a focus keyword. Select your tone if you have a preference. Choose a style. This will be a listicle. Then choose a language. There are many languages you can choose from. Select the number of outputs to generate and hit Generate. In just seconds, you will have a content structure


00:08:45        you can insert to your content area. As you can see, it adds more depth to what we have discussed earlier. Click Insert and it will be added to the content area. Remove the H1 heading, and here you go. You will have a content structure that is optimized with heading tags. So proper use of heading tag tells search engines what each section of your page is about. It helps page visitors find the information faster, and as a result, better user experience, and in return, higher chance of ranking. All right.


00:09:16        If you already have an established website, we do not recommend changing the URL or its structure, even if it doesn't follow our recommendations. Let me repeat, because this is so important. If your website is already established and your content is ranking on the search engines, do not change the URL structure because restructuring URLs, if not done properly, might have a severe impact on your site. However, if your site is relatively new and it is not getting much or any search engine traffic, then by all means, you should future proof your URLs.


00:09:47        On your WordPress site, to change the URL structure, you would hover over settings and select permalinks. By default for most WordPress installations, for some reason, the day and name option will be selected. But our recommendation to future proof your URLs to accommodate growth without needing significant overhaul is to use either the postname option that uses the page title as your URL slug, or in other words, the back of your URL, or use a custom structure that includes the category and the postname.


00:10:16        Having the postname in the URL is favored by the search engines because it gives context as to what the page is about. This on-page technique is in one of our SEO checks. If we click on the Rank Math tab, scroll down, you will see that we check for the focus keyword in the URL. And if you click on Edit Snippet, we recommend that the URL length that includes your domain name should not be longer than 75 characters. But anyway, between the custom structure and the postname structure, I personally


00:10:45        prefer the postname option because it is short and sweet and easily manageable. So let's save changes. Earlier on the post, the URL is with numbers. So let's save draft and then refresh the page. Back to the Rank Math tab and edit snippets. Now the URL slug is following the title of the page. Now we want to avoid having numbers, date, or other unnecessary parameters like the time, minute, seconds, post ID, etc. It's because it is hard for people to remember and the URLs can get very long. And if you have date and time in the URL, the question is, what if you have updated


00:11:23        your page content, yet the date and time in the URL stays outdated? It would confuse the users as well, right? So having numbers, dates, and any other unnecessary parameters makes it hard to manage the URL in the future when your site grows. There is no right or wrong answer, but it will be prudent to think ahead. It is like building a house with the potential for future extensions in mind. Your URL structure is the SEO foundation for all your posts and pages, and it needs room to grow. Okay, I've spent some time completing this article with AI, and now let's talk


00:11:57        about optimizing your meta title and description for on-page SEO. If you are interested in learning how to write high-quality articles that search engines love with the help of AI, feel free to check out this video right here. The link is in the description. All right, first things first. If we want our article to rank for the keyword, benefits of exercising, that will be our main focus keyword, and we should add it here. If you want to rank for other related keywords, such as benefit for exercise,


00:12:22        or can exercising improve physical health, you can add that to this field. For Rank Math free users, you can add up to five keywords. But if you are a Rank Math pro user, you can add unlimited keywords by default. The main focus keyword will be marked with the Star, or in other words, the first keyword in the group. If you want to change the main focus keyword, you can just drag whatever keyword you want and bring it forward. Now this will be the main focus keyword. But that's not what we want.


00:12:48        All right, when it comes to meta titles and descriptions, it is still an important on-page SEO technique because when you visit the search engine, check out one of the search results, the most prominent element of it is the SEO meta title. As a searcher, if this title catches your eye, the next thing you will see is the meta description to get a glimpse of what the page is talking about and if it is what I'm looking for. And if it is, I will click through to read the content. So optimizing your SEO meta title and description is incredibly important


00:13:18        because if it does not catch the searcher's eyes, if it is not enticing enough, and if it doesn't seem like it is what the searcher is looking for, then no one will click through to read your content no matter how great it is. To optimize for the meta title and description of a page, on Rank Maths tab, click on Edit Snippet. This is where you can edit the meta title and description. By default, if you did not matter with any of Rank Maths settings, these three variables will be added to the meta title of all your posts.


00:13:45        This title variable is taking information from the page title, but feel free to make changes to it. As you can see, any changes to this field will be reflected in the preview. Now, the best practice for meta title is if you have the main focus keyword in it, which it does. And this is part of the SEO check right here. And if you discover the title readability checks, on top of the main focus keyword at the beginning, it checks if you have a positive or negative sentiment, as well as a power word.


00:14:12        There are certain words we look for for each check, and if you click on this question mark beside each check, you will know what they are. And also it checks if you have a number in your title because studies shows that meta titles with numbers will get a higher click-through rate. This checks for the SEO title, by the way, not the page title. And then, as you can see here, we recommend that your SEO title be not more than 60 characters. Currently, it exceeds, but that's fine because search engines


00:14:39        care more about the pixel width. As long as your meta title does not go beyond 580 pixels, it is good enough. Then for the meta description, if you did not matter with any settings, Rank Math will automatically add a meta description for you. So at any one point in time, your meta description will not be left empty. Now, to best optimize the meta description, you should think about what will get people to click. If your meta title is good enough to capture the attention of searches, then it is the meta description that will get people to click through.


00:15:09        Think about the main focus keyword your page is trying to rank for. What is the search intent? If your meta description matches the search intent, it is highly likely that someone will click through. As you can see in our SEO checks, we check if your focus keyword is found in the meta description. And since the second paragraph contain the main focus keyword, we will amend the meta description accordingly. Now, the best practice is to have your meta description below 920 pixels. So maybe we can amend this a little.


00:15:37        Maybe remove this, remove this as well, change this to a comma, and change this to and many more. So the intent hasn't changed, and now the meta description fits nicely in the range. Now, in case you have troubles coming up with interesting meta titles and descriptions, fear not. You can ask Content AI to write it for you. You have 750 free credits every month anyway. If you want to learn to learn more about that, we have left a link in the description. But anyway, to generate meta title and description, simply click


00:16:07        on this Generate with AI button and Content AI will be put to work. If you like the generated output, click on Insert and they will be added here. Now, meta titles and descriptions are two of the meta text that run in the background of a page. If you want to learn more about the things that are working behind the scenes that help your sites be visible on search engines, you can check out this video right here, the link is in the description. Keyword placement is part of the foundation for SEO, even today.


00:16:34        Those search engines today are quite advanced and they claim to be able to pick up the contacts and the keywords you are trying to rank for, we shouldn't leave it to chance. We should do our part and optimize the content so that we can clearly communicate the important things we want search engines to know. We have talked about having your focus keyword in the meta title and description as well as in the URL, but where else should we strategically place the main focus keyword? Other than adding the focus keyword in the SEO meta title in the URL


00:17:02        and in the description, we should also add the main focus keyword at the beginning of the content. With it, it reinforces to the search engine what your post is about and also reassures the page visitors that they have visited the correct page. As you can see, this check checks the first 10% of the content to find the focus keyword. If they found it, then you will pass this test. For example, this content is 1, 600 words long. 10% of it means in the first 164 the words, they should find the main focus keyword.


00:17:33        It is as simple as that. Your content shouldn't be below 300 words, but if that is the case, then this SEO check will look for the main focus keyword in all the words. Now, if you pass this SEO check, then naturally it will pass the next check as well, because as long as you are using the main focus keyword once in the article, you would have passed this check. Now, if we expand the additional SEO checks, we will see that you should add the focus keyword in one of the H2, H3, or H4 heading tags.


00:18:00        Well, the key is, if there is no reason for you to add the focus keyword in one of the heading tags, you should not force it. Google and other search engines nowadays are sophisticated enough to understand your content. Then as for this, in one of your images, you should have the focus keyword in your alt text. What we recommend is to add the first image with the main focus keyword in the alt text, like this. Once you have done that, you would have passed this test. We will talk more about image alt text in a while.


00:18:28        Adding the focus keyword strategic areas will help search engines understand your page quicker. One thing for sure, the placement of the keywords in the content should flow naturally. They shouldn't be forced. Don't squeeze or staff keywords in the content. We are not in the '90s anymore. Search engines today are way sophisticated, and they will penalize you for trying to manipulate them. So beware of that. As you already know, having the main focus keyword in the alt text of an image is a good SEO practice, but you should also add alt text


00:19:00        to all your images, even if they do not contain any focus keywords. So every time you add an image to your page, you should open up the image settings and add an alt text here to describe what the image is about. There are two reasons for doing so. First, for visibly diversity impaired individuals, they may use screen readers to consume your content, and the alt text will be read as the description of the image. Secondly, for page visitors who have poor internet connection, sometimes the image may not load, and having an alt text for the image helps the visitors


00:19:31        understand what the image is about. Having an alt text for all your images is beneficial. If you have trouble coming up with a description for your images, feel free to click on this button here and Content AI will analyze the image and write a description for you. Now, Rank Math do automatically help you add an alt text to your images using the file name. Now, if you want to write it manually, don't do it. Rank Math can help you filter out those images without an image alt text, and it can generate the text inbound so you don't need to open up


00:19:59        every image and add it manually. If you want to learn how to do that, feel free to check out this video right here. The link is in the description. Now, here's one thing you should avoid when optimizing your image alt text with focus keyword. Having the main focus keyword in one of the image alt text is practically enough. You don't have to add the main focus keyword in all your images. For example, if this is the featured image of the post, it contains the main focus keyword. Then if you check out the next image, it contains the focus keyword as well.


00:20:26        Then the next image includes the focus keyword, and every image on a page includes the focus keyword. Now, if you have only four images in one article, that is fine. You can have the focus keyword in all the images. But what if you have 20 or 50 images in one page, adding the focus keyword in the alt text for all the images may get you penalized for keyword stuffing. We recommend just having the focus keyword in one of the image alt text. Possibly the first image or the featured image will be good enough.


00:20:55        These are the basic on-page SEO techniques that still work. If you are familiar With SEO, you might be wondering why we did not cover topics like mobile responsiveness, site maps, schema, page speed, and others. It is because we think they are rather technical, so we might cover them in another video, so hang tight. Anyway, we hope this video is helpful for you, and do help us out by smashing a thumbs up.

--------------------------------------


00:00:00        Hey, it's Sam Oh and welcome to the second lesson in the on-page SEO module. Today, I'm going to show you how to create a page that's optimized for search. Let's get started. So as I showed you in the last lesson, on average, the top ranking page ranks for nearly 1,000 keywords. For example, Healthline's page is clearly targeting the query, "how to lose weight fast." And sure enough, they're ranking in the top spot. Now, the traffic to this page doesn't come from just their target keyword. It comes from the combined effect of ranking for thousands of queries.


00:00:33        And when we sum up the traffic from all keywords, it makes up well over 100,000 monthly search visits just from the US. In fact, if we look at the page's keyword rankings, you'll see that the target query "how to lose weight fast" only sends them a small percentage of the total monthly search traffic. Now, in order to rank for a ton of keywords and get a ton of search traffic you need two things. The first is a page that's optimized to rank. And the second are backlinks. In this lesson, we'll cover how to create an optimized page and we'll tackle links


00:01:06        in the next module. Okay, so with on-page SEO, there are two main things we need to cover. The first is arguably the most important and that's to ensure your page satisfies searcher intent. We've already covered the 3 C's of search intent which again will give you very basic guidance on the type of content to create, the format to use, and the angle to go with. But the actual content itself is what'll leave your visitors satisfied or dissatisfied. So you might be wondering what exactly do I write about in order to satisfy searchers?


00:01:40        The short answer is to learn from your competitors. The top-ranking pages are ranking at the top for a reason. Google and other search engines deem them as the best candidates to satisfy a searcher's query. So they're clearly doing something right, at least from the perspective of a search engine. Now, while the content will vary from topic to topic, the way you research your competitors' content will be more or less the same. Let's go through an example. So let's say that we want to create content that targets the query "best golf club sets."


00:02:11        To start, I'll go to Ahrefs' Keywords Explorer and search for the query. Then, I'll scroll down to the SERP overview to see the top-ranking pages. Now, if you don't have an Ahrefs account, you can use our free SERP checker tool to do everything I'm about to do. Alright, so looking at the SERP, we want to pick out the top 3 or so relevant ranking results. And by relevant, I'm talking about pages that match the dominant search intent based on the 3 C's we've discussed so many times now. So in this case, the majority of pages are blog posts in the listicle format with freshness as


00:02:46        the content angle. So that means, we wouldn't look at pages from Amazon or Golf Galaxy because these pages are clearly ecommerce category pages, and are therefore outliers to the dominant search intent. We'll also exclude the pages from Golf Digest and Business Insider, since it doesn't look like they're intentionally targeting our query. So I'll open up these three pages in new tabs. And what we're going to look for are similarities in their content - specifically in the subtopics. And we'll also look to deepen our understanding of content format and content angle.


00:03:20        Looking at the first page, you'll see that they've created a list of categories for the best golf club sets. So there's best selling, best game improving irons, and so on. Looking further down, they have a subheading which is the make and model of the golf club set followed by a brief review of the clubs. The next page also has a summary based on more broad categories like best value, premium pick, and best choice. And based on the table of contents, you'll see that they followed a similar structure


00:03:50        where the make and model of the clubs are used as subheadings. They also add a brief description of the clubs, as well as some skimmable bullet points. And the final page does pretty much the same thing. They use subheadings as the make and model followed by a short review. Now, unless you're a golfer, you may not have caught this minor, but perhaps important detail. All of the pages talk about sets that would appeal more to beginners. For example, they all talk about Callaway's Strata set. And they all include sets from Wilson Staff.


00:04:23        In my opinion, these wouldn't appeal to an intermediate or advanced level golfer. Alright, so at this point, we know that we should create a listicle blog post with freshness as the angle. We also know that the content should likely be targeted at beginners. A couple common sets that were mentioned in all posts were the Callaway Stratas as well as a set from Wilson Staff. Now, it's important to note that you don't have to include these in your post, but it's simply an observation I had made. We also saw that the top 2 out of 3 pages had top picks for categories like "best game


00:04:57        improvement clubs" as well as "best clubs for the money." Finally, we know that the subheadings should be the name of the club set. Another thing I recommend before you start writing is to do a content gap analysis at the page level. A content gap analysis at the page level will show you common keywords that the top pages are ranking for where your page isn't. But since we don't have a page, we can still find common keyword rankings amongst a few top-ranking pages using Ahrefs' Content Gap tool.


00:05:28        To get started, go to Ahrefs' Site Explorer and paste in any one of the URLs. Next, head on over to the Content Gap tool. Now, I'm going to take the three URLs we analyzed and put them all in the top section of this tool. So what this is saying is show us keywords that any of these targets rank for where at least one of them ranks in the top 10. Now, if I run the search, you'll be able to see the keywords that these pages rank for and the position that they're ranking in. As a general rule of thumb, the more URLs that rank high for the keywords, the more


00:06:04        relevant it'll be to your content. So to narrow our search down a bit, I'll click on the "intersections" dropdown and select both 2 and 3 intersections. Meaning, only show me keywords where at least 2 of our targets are ranking in Google and at least one of those targets is ranking in the top 10. From here, just skim through the list and look for interesting subtopics that might be worth adding to your post. In addition, you may be able to learn some interesting things about the audience as well


00:06:35        as the language they use. So as you can see, people who search for this query are mostly looking for men's clubs. People want to know the best clubs for the money. They want to see cheaper options. And others are looking specifically for a set of irons. These are all things you should consider as you craft your content. Alright, so armed with this information, you should be able to create a great post with the searcher in mind. And while the content is the most important part, there are also a few more "technical"


00:07:05        on-page optimizations you should do. Let's go through a few of the most important ones. First is to include your target keyword in your title when it makes sense. Adding your target keyword to your title should come naturally. For example, our title for this post is "45 Best Free SEO Tools (Tried and Tested)." And "free seo tools" is our target keyword. Now, there'll be times when it makes more sense to use a close variant of your target keyword. For example, this post is targeting the query "how to get youtube subscribers."


00:07:39        But our title is "9 Ways to Get More YouTube Subscribers" because we went for the listicle angle. The next thing you can do is to use a short and descriptive URL slug. Short and descriptive URLs help people immediately understand what the page is about before even visiting them. Just look at these two URLs. They're on the exact same topic, but one is much more descriptive than the other. This part of the URL is called the slug. And the easiest way to choose your slug is to use your target keyword where spaces will


00:08:13        be replaced with hyphens. Again, you should only do this when it makes sense, so you don't need to worry about forcing it. Now, if you're wondering if you should use sub folders to describe categories, that's entirely up to you. Alright, next is the meta description. The meta description is HTML code that's meant to briefly summarize your page. And search engines often use this text right within the SERP. To my best knowledge, meta descriptions aren't used as a ranking signal, but they can influence


00:08:42        click-through rates. And for that reason, I think it's important to add to your pages. Now, it's important to note that according to our study of 192,000 pages, we found that Google rewrote meta descriptions nearly 63% of the time. So I wouldn't spend a ton of time on them, but you should still include them. Alright, next up is to add internal links to and from your pages. Internal links are links from one page on the same domain to another. And they're super-powerful because they can pass link authority to other relevant pages


00:09:16        and they also help search engines better understand a page's contents. For example, if I had a site in the careers niche, and I was writing a post about how to write a cover letter, then I'd definitely want to add internal links from other relevant pages like one on how to write a resume. More importantly, visitors who want to learn how to write a resume would probably want to know how to write a cover letter and vice versa. To find opportunities, you can go to Google and search for site:yourdomain.com and then


00:09:49        add the topic you're writing about. Then visit relevant pages and see if there's an opportunity to add an internal link to your new post. Alternatively, you can use Ahrefs' Site Audit tool completely free. Just sign up for an Ahrefs Webmaster Tools account, verify your site and then run a crawl. Then you can head over to Link Explorer to find internal linking opportunities. We have a short but helpful video on how to do this on Ahrefs' Product Updates YouTube channel, so I'll link that video up in the description.


00:10:21        Alright, next up is to optimize your images. In the last 28 days, we've had over 4,000 visits to our blog from Google image search. While that pales in comparison to our 500,000 monthly organic blog visits, it's still 4,000 visits. Now, optimizing your images for SEO is 3-fold. #1. Name your image files appropriately. For example, this is a picture of a puppy. If you took the photo yourself, then chances are, your smartphone or camera named it something like IMG_ and then a million numbers. Instead, change the filename to something like "puppy."


00:11:01        Not exactly rocket science, but according to Google, filenames can give Google clues about the subject matter of the image. #2. Use descriptive alt text. Alt text, short for "alternative text" is an HTML attribute that goes in your image tag. So the syntax would look something like this, where the alt value should describe the image. Alt text helps improve accessibility for those who are using screen readers or if the image fails to load, visitors will be shown the alt text instead. Now, Google recommends "creating useful, information-rich content that uses keywords


00:11:38        appropriately and is in context of the content of the page." Yes, Google explicitly says to use keywords, but they also say to avoid stuffing keywords as it results in a negative user experience and may cause your site to be seen as spam. Meaning, don't do something like this. Now, looking back at the syntax, our alt text isn't exactly descriptive. So let's change that to something like "puppy sitting on a couch." If you use WordPress, just add your alt text here when inserting your images and the CMS


00:12:11        should do the rest. Alright, the third thing you'll want to do is compress your images. Compressing images makes your image file sizes smaller, leading to faster load times. And PageSpeed is a Google ranking signal. There's a free tool for compressing images called "ShortPixel" which has both a web interface as well as a WordPress plugin. And the last thing I highly recommend is to optimize for readability. Here are 5 simple but effective tips you can use to improve readability. #1. Write in short sentences and short paragraphs because no one wants to


00:12:44        land on a page with a huge wall of text. #2. Use descriptive subheadings so people who are skimming the article can easily find the things that are important to them. #3. Use a large enough font that's easily readable on both desktop and mobile. #4. Avoid using big words. It's more important that people understand your content. And #5. Write as you speak. Your content will be more conversational and entertaining to read. A free tool I recommend using is called Hemingway app. It'll give you some writing tips as well as a readability grade.


00:13:20        I'd recommend trying to keep things at or below a sixth-grade level. Now, there are other on-page optimizations you can do like adding open graph meta tags or OG tags for short. These will allow you to customize the titles, descriptions, images, and other information when your pages are shared on social media networks. There's also Schema markup, which is code that helps search engines understand your content and better represent it in the search results. For example, these pages use the recipe Schema type so Google is able to show


00:13:51        things like the recipe's rating, the number of votes, the total time to make the food, as well as nutritional information. If you have a WordPress site, then you can add OG tags and schema with plugins like RankMath or Yoast. Now again, the most important part of your content is that you're striving to satisfy searcher intent. Yes, the technical things are important too, but they're more like the icing on the cake. So here's a full on-page SEO checklist. Take a screenshot and make sure to subscribe to our channel because next week, I'll be


00:14:23        releasing our next module on an SEO strategy called link building. Or if you're watching this at a later date, all of the links to our videos should be in the description. I'll see you in the next module.

Your content will be more conversational and entertaining to read. A free tool I recommend using is called Hemingway app. It'll give you some writing tips as well as a readability grade.


00:13:20        I'd recommend trying to keep things at or below a sixth-grade level. Now, there are other on-page optimizations you can do like adding open graph meta tags or OG tags for short. These will allow you to customize the titles, descriptions, images, and other information when your pages are shared on social media networks. There's also Schema markup, which is code that helps search engines understand your content and better represent it in the search results. For example, these pages use the recipe Schema type so Google is able to show


00:13:51        things like the recipe's rating, the number of votes, the total time to make the food, as well as nutritional information. If you have a WordPress site, then you can add OG tags and schema with plugins like RankMath or Yoast. Now again, the most important part of your content is that you're striving to satisfy searcher intent. Yes, the technical things are important too, but they're more like the icing on the cake. So here's a full on-page SEO checklist. Take a screenshot and make sure to subscribe to our channel because next week, I'll be


00:14:23        releasing our next module on an SEO strategy called link building. Or if you're watching this at a later date, all of the links to our videos should be in the description. I'll see you in the next module.


-----------------------------


00:00:00        Hey, it's Sam Oh and welcome to the second module which is about on-page SEO. If you haven't seen the introduction to SEO video and the module on keyword research, then I highly recommend watching those first. They'll help you get the foundational knowledge you'll need to get the most out of this module. I'll leave links in the description. Alright, so what is on-page SEO? It's simply the practice of optimizing web pages to rank higher in search engines. And it revolves heavily around optimizing pages for search intent.


00:00:30        But on-page optimizations also involve creating and optimizing HTML tags like titles and meta descriptions. Now, if you've been exposed to the practice of on-page SEO, then it's quite likely that you've heard conflicting advice. And for that reason, we're going to discuss both what on-page SEO is and what it is not. Let's talk about common advice you might see on on-page SEO best practices which just aren't true today. And while there are many old-school tactics that are still being recommended, I want to


00:01:03        focus on just 3 points to help you navigate the noise. #1. On-page SEO is not about stuffing exact match keywords. It used to be common practice to include the exact keyword you wanted to rank for in your title, URL, and content. For example, if you wanted to rank for "Car dealer San Diego" you would stuff that keyword throughout your page despite the fact it doesn't make sense - grammatically speaking. Google is smart enough to understand things like connecting words, synonyms, and closely related words and phrases.


00:01:38        In fact, for all of these queries, the top 10 pages are nearly identical. Unfortunately, stuffing exact match keywords is still being practiced today which can lead to poor user experience and poor readability; all things that on-page SEO should not do. The second thing is that on-page SEO is not about using your keyword a specific number of times on the page. In our study of 3 million search queries, we found that on average, the top-ranking page ranks for around 1,000 other relevant keywords in the top 10.


00:02:14        Now, can you imagine what it would be like if a top-ranking page had to mention all 1,000 of those keywords at least three times? It makes no sense. The content would be unnecessarily lengthy and create an awful user experience for visitors. Here's an example. Look at the SERP for the query "diet plan." You'll see that Healthline's article on "how to lose weight" ranks #1. And there's no mention of a "diet plan" in their title or URL. In fact, there's only one fleeting mention of it on the page.


00:02:45        Not even a subheading. Here's another example: GQ ranks in the top spot for "classiest watch." But if we look at the page, you'll see that the word "classiest" isn't there. And neither is the word "classy." The third point is that on-page SEO isn't about meeting a minimum word count. Some studies have shown that the average content length of the top 10 results is over 2,000 words. As a result, many SEOs have recommended that you create pages that are at least that length. But that isn't exactly sound advice.


00:03:19        For example, our backlink checker is 628 words, yet we rank #1 for our target keyword and the page generates around 130,000 monthly visits from Google search alone. Here's another example. This page only has 76 words on it. The majority of content are images. According to Ahrefs Site Explorer, the page gets over 170,000 monthly search visits. Now, let's talk about what on-page SEO is today in 2021 and beyond. Looking at the definition again, on-page SEO is the practice of optimizing web pages to


00:03:55        rank higher in search engines. And as I mentioned, this revolves heavily around optimizing pages for search intent. The keyword here is "search intent." Translation: the goal of your pages should be to satisfy the searcher's intent. How? Well, we talked about the 3 C's of search intent which should help you get the basic stuff down like the content type, format, and angle. In addition to this, your content needs to address the things people expect to see. You'll also want to nail the more "tangible" items like titles, subheadings, internal linking,


00:04:30        readability, and of course, the actual content itself. These are the things we'll be answering in part 2 of our on-page SEO module, where we'll get more tactical and talk about how you can create content that's optimized for search. This video is set to release in a couple of days, so be sure to subscribe so you don't miss out on that. Or if you're watching at a later time, check the description in this video where we have links to all of the lessons in this SEO course. I'll see you in the next lesson.

For example, the motion picture known as "Ghostbusters" whose titleEIDR is "10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J" has several edits, e.g. "10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I" and "10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3".


Since schema.org types like Movie and TVEpisode can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use titleEIDR alone (for a general description), or alongside editEIDR for a more edit-specific description.
	editor
	Person
	Specifies the Person who edited the CreativeWork.

	maintainer
	Organization  or
Person
	A maintainer of a Dataset, software package (SoftwareApplication), or other Project. A maintainer is a Person or Organization that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on "upstream" sources. When maintainer is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a Dataset, it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The isBasedOn property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work.

Use businessFunction to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a Demand. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer.
Inverse property: itemOffered
	pattern
	DefinedTerm  or
Text
	A pattern that something has, for example 'polka dot', 'striped', 'Canadian flag'. Values are typically expressed as text, although links to controlled value schemes are also supported.

Text
	The position of an item in a series or sequence of items.

URL
	The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via URL) a document describing the editorial principles of an Organization (or individual, e.g. a Person writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a CreativeWork (e.g. NewsArticle) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the CreativeWork.


While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a funder) can be expressed using schema.org terminology.
	recordedAt
	Event
	The Event where the CreativeWork was recorded. The CreativeWork may capture all or part of the event.
Inverse property: recordedIn
	releasedEvent
	PublicationEvent
	The place and time the release was issued, expressed as a PublicationEvent.
	review
	Review
	A review of the item. Supersedes reviews.
	schemaVersion
	Text  or
URL
	Indicates (by URL or string) a particular version of a schema used in some CreativeWork. This property was created primarily to indicate the use of a specific schema.org release, e.g. 10.0 as a simple string, or more explicitly via URL, https://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v10.0. There may be situations in which other schemas might usefully be referenced this way, e.g. http://dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dces/1999-07-02/ but this has not been carefully explored in the community.
	sdDatePublished
	Date
	Indicates the date on which the current structured data was generated / published. Typically used alongside sdPublisher.
	sdLicense
	CreativeWork  or
URL
	A license document that applies to this structured data, typically indicated by URL.
	sdPublisher
	Organization  or
Person
	Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site. For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing content with more explicitly structured metadata. The sdPublisher property helps make such practices more explicit.
	size
	DefinedTerm  or
QuantitativeValue  or
SizeSpecification  or
Text
	A standardized size of a product or creative work, specified either through a simple textual string (for example 'XL', '32Wx34L'), a QuantitativeValue with a unitCode, or a comprehensive and structured SizeSpecification; in other cases, the width, height, depth and weight properties may be more applicable.
	sourceOrganization
	Organization
	The Organization on whose behalf the creator was working.
	spatial
	Place
	The "spatial" property can be used in cases when more specific properties (e.g. locationCreated, spatialCoverage, contentLocation) are not known to be appropriate.
	spatialCoverage
	Place
	The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York.
	sponsor
	Organization  or
Person
	A person or organization that supports a thing through a pledge, promise, or financial contribution. E.g. a sponsor of a Medical Study or a corporate sponsor of an event.
	teaches
	DefinedTerm  or
Text
	The item being described is intended to help a person learn the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term.
	temporal
	DateTime  or
Text
	The "temporal" property can be used in cases where more specific properties (e.g. temporalCoverage, dateCreated, dateModified, datePublished) are not known to be appropriate.
	temporalCoverage
	DateTime  or
Text  or
URL
	The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format. In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written "2011/2012"). Other forms of content, e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode, may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via "1939/1945".


Open-ended date ranges can be written with ".." in place of the end date. For example, "2015-11/.." indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. Supersedes datasetTimeInterval.
	text
	Text
	The textual content of this CreativeWork.
	thumbnail
	ImageObject
	Thumbnail image for an image or video.
	thumbnailUrl
	URL
	A thumbnail image relevant to the Thing.

	Duration
	Approximate or typical time it usually takes to work with or through the content of this work for the typical or target audience.
	translationOfWork
	CreativeWork
	The work that this work has been translated from. E.g. 物种起源 is a translationOf “On the Origin of Species”.
Inverse property: workTranslation
	translator
	Organization  or
Person
	Organization or person who adapts a creative work to different languages, regional differences and technical requirements of a target market, or that translates during some event.
	typicalAgeRange
	Text
	The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'.
	usageInfo
	CreativeWork  or
URL
	The schema.org usageInfo property indicates further information about a CreativeWork. This property is applicable both to works that are freely available and to those that require payment or other transactions. It can reference additional information, e.g. community expectations on preferred linking and citation conventions, as well as purchasing details. For something that can be commercially licensed, usageInfo can provide detailed, resource-specific information about licensing options.


This property can be used alongside the license property which indicates license(s) applicable to some piece of content. The usageInfo property can provide information about other licensing options, e.g. acquiring commercial usage rights for an image that is also available under non-commercial creative commons licenses.
	version
	Number  or
Text

	Properties from Thing
	additionalType
	Text  or
URL
	An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide.
	alternateName
	Text
	An alias for the item.
	description
	Text  or
TextObject
	A description of the item.
	disambiguatingDescription
	Text
	A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation.
	identifier
	PropertyValue  or
Text  or
URL
	The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See background notes for more details.

In the case of TV and movie, this would be the country of the principle offices of the production company or individual responsible for the movie. For other kinds of CreativeWork it is difficult to provide fully general guidance, and properties such as contentLocation and locationCreated may be more applicable.

In the case of products, the country of origin of the product. The exact interpretation of this may vary by context and product type, and cannot be fully enumerated here.
creativeWorkStatus	DefinedTerm  or

For example, the motion picture known as "Ghostbusters" whose titleEIDR is "10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J" has several edits, e.g. "10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I" and "10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3".

Since schema.org types like Movie and TVEpisode can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use titleEIDR alone (for a general description), or alongside editEIDR for a more edit-specific description.
editor	Person	Specifies the Person who edited the CreativeWork.
educationalAlignment	AlignmentObject	An alignment to an established educational framework.

This property should not be used where the nature of the alignment can be described using a simple property, for example to express that a resource teaches or assesses a competency.
educationalLevel	DefinedTerm  or

Unregistered or niche encoding and file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia/Wikidata entry. Supersedes fileFormat.
exampleOfWork	CreativeWork	A creative work that this work is an example/instance/realization/derivation of.
Inverse property: workExample
expires	Date  or
DateTime	Date the content expires and is no longer useful or available.

maintainer	Organization  or
Person	A maintainer of a Dataset, software package (SoftwareApplication), or other Project. A maintainer is a Person or Organization that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on "upstream" sources. When maintainer is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a Dataset, it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The isBasedOn property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work.
material	Product  or
Text  or
URL	A material that something is made from, e.g. leather, wool, cotton, paper.

offers	Demand  or
Offer	An offer to provide this item—for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use businessFunction to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a Demand. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer.
Inverse property: itemOffered
pattern	DefinedTerm  or
Text	A pattern that something has, for example 'polka dot', 'striped', 'Canadian flag'. Values are typically expressed as text, although links to controlled value schemes are also supported.
position	Integer  or
Text	The position of an item in a series or sequence of items.
producer	Organization  or
Person	The person or organization who produced the work (e.g. music album, movie, TV/radio series etc.).

publishingPrinciples	CreativeWork  or
URL	The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via URL) a document describing the editorial principles of an Organization (or individual, e.g. a Person writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a CreativeWork (e.g. NewsArticle) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the CreativeWork.

While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a funder) can be expressed using schema.org terminology.
recordedAt	Event	The Event where the CreativeWork was recorded. The CreativeWork may capture all or part of the event.
Inverse property: recordedIn
releasedEvent	PublicationEvent	The place and time the release was issued, expressed as a PublicationEvent.
review	Review	A review of the item. Supersedes reviews.
schemaVersion	Text  or
URL	Indicates (by URL or string) a particular version of a schema used in some CreativeWork. This property was created primarily to indicate the use of a specific schema.org release, e.g. 10.0 as a simple string, or more explicitly via URL, https://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v10.0. There may be situations in which other schemas might usefully be referenced this way, e.g. http://dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dces/1999-07-02/ but this has not been carefully explored in the community.
sdDatePublished	Date	Indicates the date on which the current structured data was generated / published. Typically used alongside sdPublisher.
sdLicense	CreativeWork  or
URL	A license document that applies to this structured data, typically indicated by URL.
sdPublisher	Organization  or
Person	Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site. For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing content with more explicitly structured metadata. The sdPublisher property helps make such practices more explicit.
size	DefinedTerm  or
QuantitativeValue  or
SizeSpecification  or
Text	A standardized size of a product or creative work, specified either through a simple textual string (for example 'XL', '32Wx34L'), a QuantitativeValue with a unitCode, or a comprehensive and structured SizeSpecification; in other cases, the width, height, depth and weight properties may be more applicable.
sourceOrganization	Organization	The Organization on whose behalf the creator was working.
spatial	Place	The "spatial" property can be used in cases when more specific properties (e.g. locationCreated, spatialCoverage, contentLocation) are not known to be appropriate.
spatialCoverage	Place	The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York.
sponsor	Organization  or
Person	A person or organization that supports a thing through a pledge, promise, or financial contribution. E.g. a sponsor of a Medical Study or a corporate sponsor of an event.
teaches	DefinedTerm  or
Text	The item being described is intended to help a person learn the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term.
temporal	DateTime  or
Text	The "temporal" property can be used in cases where more specific properties (e.g. temporalCoverage, dateCreated, dateModified, datePublished) are not known to be appropriate.
temporalCoverage	DateTime  or
Text  or
URL	The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format. In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written "2011/2012"). Other forms of content, e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode, may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via "1939/1945".

Open-ended date ranges can be written with ".." in place of the end date. For example, "2015-11/.." indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. Supersedes datasetTimeInterval.
text	Text	The textual content of this CreativeWork.
thumbnail	ImageObject	Thumbnail image for an image or video.
thumbnailUrl	URL	A thumbnail image relevant to the Thing.
timeRequired	Duration	Approximate or typical time it usually takes to work with or through the content of this work for the typical or target audience.

Inverse property: workTranslation
translator	Organization  or
Person	Organization or person who adapts a creative work to different languages, regional differences and technical requirements of a target market, or that translates during some event.
typicalAgeRange	Text	The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'.
usageInfo	CreativeWork  or
URL	The schema.org usageInfo property indicates further information about a CreativeWork. This property is applicable both to works that are freely available and to those that require payment or other transactions. It can reference additional information, e.g. community expectations on preferred linking and citation conventions, as well as purchasing details. For something that can be commercially licensed, usageInfo can provide detailed, resource-specific information about licensing options.

This property can be used alongside the license property which indicates license(s) applicable to some piece of content. The usageInfo property can provide information about other licensing options, e.g. acquiring commercial usage rights for an image that is also available under non-commercial creative commons licenses.
version	Number  or
Text	The version of the CreativeWork embodied by a specified resource.
video	Clip  or
VideoObject	An embedded video object.
wordCount	Integer	The number of words in the text of the CreativeWork such as an Article, Book, etc.
workExample	CreativeWork	Example/instance/realization/derivation of the concept of this creative work. E.g. the paperback edition, first edition, or e-book.

A Schema.org Type
Thing > CreativeWork > Article > SocialMediaPosting > BlogPosting
[more...]
A blog post.
Property	Expected Type	Description
Properties from SocialMediaPosting
sharedContent	CreativeWork	A CreativeWork such as an image, video, or audio clip shared as part of this posting.
Properties from Article
articleBody	Text	The actual body of the article.
articleSection	Text	Articles may belong to one or more 'sections' in a magazine or newspaper, such as Sports, Lifestyle, etc.
backstory	CreativeWork  or
Text	For an Article, typically a NewsArticle, the backstory property provides a textual summary giving a brief explanation of why and how an article was created. In a journalistic setting this could include information about reporting process, methods, interviews, data sources, etc.
pageEnd	Integer  or
Text	The page on which the work ends; for example "138" or "xvi".
pageStart	Integer  or
Text	The page on which the work starts; for example "135" or "xiii".
pagination	Text	Any description of pages that is not separated into pageStart and pageEnd; for example, "1-6, 9, 55" or "10-12, 46-49".
speakable	SpeakableSpecification  or
URL	Indicates sections of a Web page that are particularly 'speakable' in the sense of being highlighted as being especially appropriate for text-to-speech conversion. Other sections of a page may also be usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable' property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech.

The speakable property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values:

1.) id-value URL references - uses id-value of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of speakable has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned.

2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, e.g. via class attribute. Use the cssSelector property.

3.) XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the xpath property.

For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this we define a supporting type, SpeakableSpecification which is defined to be a possible value of the speakable property.

For example, the motion picture known as "Ghostbusters" whose titleEIDR is "10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J" has several edits, e.g. "10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I" and "10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3".

Since schema.org types like Movie and TVEpisode can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use titleEIDR alone (for a general description), or alongside editEIDR for a more edit-specific description.
editor	Person	Specifies the Person who edited the CreativeWork.
educationalAlignment	AlignmentObject	An alignment to an established educational framework.

This property should not be used where the nature of the alignment can be described using a simple property, for example to express that a resource teaches or assesses a competency.

exampleOfWork	CreativeWork	A creative work that this work is an example/instance/realization/derivation of.
Inverse property: workExample
expires	Date  or
DateTime	Date the content expires and is no longer useful or available.

Person	A maintainer of a Dataset, software package (SoftwareApplication), or other Project. A maintainer is a Person or Organization that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact.

When maintainer is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a Dataset, it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The isBasedOn property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work.

Offer	An offer to provide this item—for example, an offer to sell a product, rent the DVD of a movie, perform a service, or give away tickets to an event. Use businessFunction to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a Demand. While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer.
Inverse property: itemOffered
pattern	DefinedTerm  or
Text	A pattern that something has, for example 'polka dot', 'striped', 'Canadian flag'. Values are typically expressed as text, although links to controlled value schemes are also supported.

URL	The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via URL) a document describing the editorial principles of an Organization (or individual, e.g. a Person writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a CreativeWork (e.g. NewsArticle) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the CreativeWork.

While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a funder) can be expressed using schema.org terminology.
recordedAt	Event	The Event where the CreativeWork was recorded. The CreativeWork may capture all or part of the event.
Inverse property: recordedIn
releasedEvent	PublicationEvent	The place and time the release was issued, expressed as a PublicationEvent.
review	Review	A review of the item. Supersedes reviews.
schemaVersion	Text  or
URL	Indicates (by URL or string) a particular version of a schema used in some CreativeWork. This property was created primarily to indicate the use of a specific schema.org release, e.g. 10.0 as a simple string, or more explicitly via URL, https://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v10.0. There may be situations in which other schemas might usefully be referenced this way, e.g. http://dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dces/1999-07-02/ but this has not been carefully explored in the community.
sdDatePublished	Date	Indicates the date on which the current structured data was generated / published. Typically used alongside sdPublisher.
sdLicense	CreativeWork  or
URL	A license document that applies to this structured data, typically indicated by URL.
sdPublisher	Organization  or
Person	Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site. For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing content with more explicitly structured metadata. The sdPublisher property helps make such practices more explicit.
size	DefinedTerm  or
QuantitativeValue  or
SizeSpecification  or
Text	A standardized size of a product or creative work, specified either through a simple textual string (for example 'XL', '32Wx34L'), a QuantitativeValue with a unitCode, or a comprehensive and structured SizeSpecification; in other cases, the width, height, depth and weight properties may be more applicable.
sourceOrganization	Organization	The Organization on whose behalf the creator was working.
spatial	Place	The "spatial" property can be used in cases when more specific properties (e.g. locationCreated, spatialCoverage, contentLocation) are not known to be appropriate.
spatialCoverage	Place	The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York.
sponsor	Organization  or
Person	A person or organization that supports a thing through a pledge, promise, or financial contribution. E.g. a sponsor of a Medical Study or a corporate sponsor of an event.
teaches	DefinedTerm  or
Text	The item being described is intended to help a person learn the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term.
temporal	DateTime  or
Text	The "temporal" property can be used in cases where more specific properties (e.g. temporalCoverage, dateCreated, dateModified, datePublished) are not known to be appropriate.
temporalCoverage	DateTime  or
Text  or
URL	The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format. In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written "2011/2012"). Other forms of content, e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode, may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via "1939/1945".

Open-ended date ranges can be written with ".." in place of the end date. For example, "2015-11/.." indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. Supersedes datasetTimeInterval.
text	Text	The textual content of this CreativeWork.
thumbnail	ImageObject	Thumbnail image for an image or video.
thumbnailUrl	URL	A thumbnail image relevant to the Thing.
timeRequired	Duration	Approximate or typical time it usually takes to work with or through the content of this work for the typical or target audience.

Person	Organization or person who adapts a creative work to different languages, regional differences and technical requirements of a target market, or that translates during some event.
typicalAgeRange	Text	The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'.
usageInfo	CreativeWork  or
URL	The schema.org usageInfo property indicates further information about a CreativeWork. This property is applicable both to works that are freely available and to those that require payment or other transactions. It can reference additional information, e.g. community expectations on preferred linking and citation conventions, as well as purchasing details. For something that can be commercially licensed, usageInfo can provide detailed, resource-specific information about licensing options.

This property can be used alongside the license property which indicates license(s) applicable to some piece of content. The usageInfo property can provide information about other licensing options, e.g. acquiring commercial usage rights for an image that is also available under non-commercial creative commons licenses.
version	Number  or
Text	The version of the CreativeWork embodied by a specified resource.
video	Clip  or
VideoObject	An embedded video object.
wordCount	Integer	The number of words in the text of the CreativeWork such as an Article, Book, etc.

workTranslation	CreativeWork	A work that is a translation of the content of this work. E.g. 西遊記 has an English workTranslation “Journey to the West”, a German workTranslation “Monkeys Pilgerfahrt” and a Vietnamese translation Tây du ký bình khảo.
Inverse property: translationOfWork
Properties from Thing
additionalType	Text  or
URL	An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org style guide.
